We were on a family trip to celebrate my daughterâ€™s birthday. Our first flight were delayed by almost 2 hours. Because of that reason we lost our connection flight from SFO to LAX. Staff were rude, they booked us in separated seats (even my 5 yo daughter). Our second flight was also delayed by more than 1 hour. They ruined our mood and our trip. We weâ€™re exhausted after spending an entire day at the airport with a 5 yo who couldnâ€™t wait to get to Disneyland. We asked the staff at Vancouver to move us to a direct flight and they refused to do it. No customer service. It was a nightmare.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This was one of the worst flying experiences I have ever had. First the check in staff were rude and told us as we were boarding that the overhead bins were already full (why?) and we had to check in our cabin baggage. They told us that it would be checked through to Auckland. When I said no, they insisted or we couldn\\'t fly. We still had a 12.5 hour flight from LA to NZ after this one with no carry on and whatever we could keep on us personally. Get on the plane no greeting, ignored. Inflight, crew scowling at passengers. One crew member, while collecting rubbish, looked each passenger in the face and just said \"trash\" at them. Land in LA, no idea where we had to go for our connecting flight, no info anywhere. Went to the United customer service and asked them, they were annoyed we were asking and pointed to where we had to go. I double checked that our luggage was checked all the way through and we were asked for our bag tags. The United check in person back in Washington hadn\\'t given us any on our boarding passes! Finally get to Auckland, no luggage, even the carry on. United hadn\\'t loaded any of it onto ANZ. Been home for 24 hours now, no luggage still. This also happened to two other people on our flight to NZ, they flew United from Florida to LA and none of their luggage arrived in NZ either. When I reached out to United, they blamed Air NZ. I will never fly this airline again under any circumstances.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Worst experience of my life. I booked round tickets for me and my family with united Airlines. I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 24 march with my family (wife, one child and one infant) and my return ticket was for 24th April (Delhi to Newark. But when we went to Delhi airport for flight check-in on 24th April, airport officers/check-In counter told us that my infant baby ticket is suspended by United Airlines (they gave us proof also), and they canâ€™t issue boarding pass for Infant. When we contacted United Airlines customer care at same time then they told us that my infant ticket is suspended because as per united airline records my infant baby did not travel to Delhi from Newark (EWR) on 24th March 2019 and thatâ€™s why United Airline suspended my infant ticket because of no show and we missed our flight due to suspended status of infant ticket. We have Infant boarding pass(EWR to DEL), I am not sure how come a International Airline can miss something like this. Initially they told us that they donâ€™t have any seat available till 5th May and we can reissue 3 tickets for 5th May 2019 but asked to buy Infant ticket as he is turning 2 years on 1 May 2019. After many effort we were able to get reissue of tickets for 28th April but with different route, DEL to HKG and HKG to EWR', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I have flown United a few times at this point and when booking didnâ€™t think anything of it because I was hoping to get more miles. Unfortunately the screen malfunctioned on the plane. Now, I know, TVs on a plane in general is a luxury. However, this was a 5 hour flight which resulted in a lengthy delay at 11 at night and for those who struggle to sleep in an aisle seat and very long and entertain-less flight. Not to mention food and drink only happened once that I remember and thereâ€™s really no benefits to being a mileage plus member. I worry about my next flight out there to see my partner.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Fort Lauderdale. Avoid avoid avoid. I will never fly United again. There are weirdly cryptic baggage fees, consistently late flights, and horrible customer service. If you can, I would advise steering very clear of this airline.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Newark to Albany. I travel for work extensively. I sincerely try to avoid taking United at all costs. Unfortunately. My last 3 flights were with United. Travel with your organization is truly frustrating. Your flights are never on time, you charge ridiculous prices for services that are either free or half the cost with your competitors. Even your own employees seem frustrated working for your organization. I am writing this review to let less experienced travelers know. If you have other flight options, please use them. United will be routinely late, you will miss connections and they will nickel and dime you for everything. Their staff can be extremely unhelpful and essentially take the attitude that you are stuck with their inferior service and high fees.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I don't even know where to begin. I flew from London to Chicago with a transit in Brussels. First of all, my connecting flight was overbooked so they made me wait for a very long time before finally letting me and many others waiting know that we will have a seat on the plane. They also forced me to check in my hand luggage which contained critical documents that I needed because the flight was overbooked. The worst is yet to come. I waited for an hour in Chicago for my luggage but it never came. I went to the United counter and they told me it never left London and they told me that they will put my luggage on the next flight but guess what, it's been 24 hours and I've been on the phone with them twice and nobody can locate my luggage. Not a single person. I flew to Chicago to attend my sister's graduation so now I'm stranded with no toiletries, no clothes and all they can say is for me to keep my receipts. I am also sure that I'll be getting reimbursed 2 months later. United is the worst airline with no manners at all. Do not start their Mileage Program because they don't even have great benefits. I will go back to American Airlines who were very helpful when a similar situation happened in the past and they were able to ship my luggage the next day.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | First off our flight was cancelled due to crew scheduling conflict, while booking a different flight they didnâ€™t have a seat for my husband so put him on standby. Then wanted to send us 1/2 way back to where we arrived from, where we would lay over for almost 18hrs, which didnâ€™t happen because it turned out my husbands stand by ticket was no good. They did give us a hotel vouched to stay and fly out the next morning. We get to gate D2 only to find out our gate had been switched to D32 without notification. Iâ€™ll never use United again! Also the employees are very rude!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Guatemala City to Houston via Frankfurt. The company has no idea how to deal with the transfer of the luggage, someone says the customers shall pick it up and board it again during the transit, someone else says that there is no need. Result my luggage got stuck in Houston. Food is poor, air conditioning too cold, embarrassing entertainment system, no space for legs at all.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Columbus to Milwaukee via Chicago. I will do anything in my power to never fly United again including getting to my final destination late. Rude employees, late flights, changing gates several times and wait times for baggage claim over the phone of over 30 minutes. They donâ€™t care and it shows!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Monroe. First of all, they, the United airlines have bad management in technical glitches, they simply don't know how to manage the passages or travellers. I flew from Denver after a business meeting to Houston and supposed to connect to Monroe, I landed on 2nd May 2019 at 11:00 pm and I was supposed to be landed at 8:30 pm, coz of 'so called' bad weather. They had cancelled the flight to Monroe which was expected to take off at 9:30 pm. When I checked with support staff, they asked me to stay at hotel for overnight which I need to pay from my pocket. The next day I waited all day in the airport and they gave a flight at 9:45 pm, which was again 30 mins late. Guys just avoid United for any given case, or avoid coming to Houston as connecting flight.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to San Antonio. I donâ€™t remember the last time I had a flight on time with this airline. Then again today I am trying to head home to see family and get home from working all week and my plane was delayed for two hours, we got boarded then they decide to tell us they are delaying it again for three more hours! We all had to unboard and wait around to see what they are doing. The workers at the desk are rude in any state Iâ€™m in. Iâ€™m so tired of United. I do not plan on using them again. I understand some delays. You canâ€™t help the weather but this is getting ridiculous.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Hartford to Des Moines via Chicago. So, my daughter and I went to Iowa from Connecticut to visit my son. When we went to retrieve our luggage, my daughters never showed up. We spoke with someone at baggage claim and they filed a claim and said it mustâ€™ve gone somewhere else. We had purchased items just for this trip, now we have to not only replace the items we bought but now we have to purchase her all new clothes. We spent money we hadnâ€™t budgeted for and when we returned home we were told that her luggage was found and it went to Albuquerque, NM. She sent in her receipts and received her luggage, finally, only to find that they had damaged the suitcase. They called and she was work so she asked me to call them back. The automated system does not make it easy to get a human being and then I finally get a human from another country who can barely speak English. He let me know that it will be 6-8 weeks for them to review the case. So United sent her luggage to another state, we had to spend money we hadnâ€™t budgeted for and they broke her luggage and now we have to wait to get our money back. I will never use United again..', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | On April 19, 2019 we were scheduled to fly from New Orleans to Newark at 1:10P.M. I received no communication from United, none at all indicating there was any change in the schedule. I printed out our boarding passes in advance, got to the airport 2 hours before flight time, went through security and to the gate with noone at any time saying the flight was cancelled. When we got to the gate, the board said the flight was cancelled. Noone from United was even there to assist us, to help us reschedule. We were left on our own. Thank God Delta personnel were in the terminal at another gate and were so helpful to us. If we left it to United, we would still be there. They didn't are at all about their customers. Because of United's horrendous customer service, we had to wait 8 hours and then fly back with Delta and fly into LaGuardia thereby incurring another $100 expense to get to Newark at 1:00A.M. in the morning of the next day. I contacted Customer Service and I requested $470.00 which is exactly one half of the total price paid for the roundtrip. All they have offered is a $75.00 travel voucher. In the future, I would rather pay more with Delta than fly with the unfriendly skies of United!\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Nashville to San Francisco. Paid for seat, refuse to assign. I have a reservation for Oct 6, 2019. I paid for a seat months ago. I have called three times to confirm my seat assignment. Each time, I am told that I cannot get a seat assigned. During my second call, a Supervisor said that he assigned me a seat and ended the call, but I found out that he lied when I called back to confirm a third time. I have been on the phone with them an hour and a half during my third call bit am being told that others are being assigned seats but one cannot be assigned to me even though I paid for one.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | The worst thing that can happen when you travel international is loosing your passport. My flight was Montreal - Newark - Myrtle Beach, I forgot mine in the magazine compartment in front of me on the flight to Myrtle Beach. I realize that 20 feet past the gate so I try to go back to the plane, I cannot itâ€™s the law, ok I get it! The girl at the counter communicated with another one in the plane, after 3 messages I hear passport negative for seat 10f. I canâ€™t believe it, it was just in front of the seat in the magazine compartment, the girl at the counter is 0 help and thatâ€™s it, itâ€™s not there. Itâ€™s a passport not earphone, kind of important when you travel internationally! A couple of days later my passport is found at Chicago airport, so it was in the plane and the girl just did not check properly, I had to rebook domestic to Burlington for 300$ and have someone pick me up there and pass Canadian custom by car to enter Canada without a passport, worst customer service I can imagine, they just didnâ€™t care! I donâ€™t think I will ever fly United ever again. I cannot understand how someone can be so unhelpful with something as important as a passport especially since I knew exactly where it was United never again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Milwaukee. Negatives: Not comfortable seating, ticket prices are more expensive than most airlines, can only bring 1 carry on and 1 personal bag for free, must pay to check a bag, no leg room on plane, flight attendants were not friendly Positives: ...I honestly canâ€™t think of any... Story: â€œThe flight attendants are not here to provide you beverages and snacks, they are here for your safetyâ€\\x9d -Captain. That was how the captain, greeted everyone after everyone had been seated. If youâ€™re looking for seats with barely any cushion to them and the most unorganized crew members, fly United. While it was only a 2 hour plane ride to and from I will definitely never be flying United ever again. The bus ride from the airport to the rental car place had WAY more comfortable seating than the plane and itâ€™s not like you can reserve what kind of plane you want. So for my 6â€\\x9d 4 boyfriend he couldnâ€™t even sit up fully or his head would hit the ceiling. Then when we landed there was no one there to open the gate for us. So we had to wait that much longer for the whoever to figure it out. Point blank donâ€™t fly United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | The people in Newark were helpful since we were unable to book our flights in the same seats. My 4 year old daughter was moved it a seat next to my husband and that was great. When we arrived at SFO I asked for either me or my husband to be moved next to her and they refused. Said I had to wait at least an hour before boarding to move seats. When I asked about our seats boarding was set to being in just 20 min, I mentioned that and the lady at gate 77C just walked away. So yeah now Iâ€™m stuck with my 4 year old sitting next to starters because someone didnâ€™t feel like helping.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Denver to Charleston. The flight had several delays and unlike Frontier when we finally arrived to the airport they did not allow people with close connecting flights to exit first. They also did not call ahead to the connecting flights like other airlines to allow passengers to still board. Then when I finally get to the gate five minutes late they would not allow us to board. We had to go all the way back to customer service which was not close for assistance', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Lake Charles to Houston via Corpus Christi.

When asked prior to boarding for help switching they were no help at all and that I would have to figure it out on board. Once I board I asked the stewardess to help me see if someone would switch and she said she does not do this. I expressed that I was terribly afraid to fly and did not want to sit near strangers.

Discovered my seat like this. Flight attendants didnâ€™t want to give me anything to wipe this mess up with. Made me wait for 20 minutes to get a wet paper towel. One I cleaned it up, it took another 20 minutes to take the dirty towel. Then when she had gloves on, she wouldnâ€™t take the towel from me. I was in the window seat and unable to get out, so I threw the towel in the aisle where it remained for another hour. I reported this to Unitedâ€™s website and have had very little contact.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to San Diego via San Francisco. For the first time in 15 years and hundreds of thousands of miles of airline travel, I was forced to gate-check my carry-on luggage because the overhead space was full. This normally would not have been an issue, except that upon arriving at San Francisco, I received a message requiring me to re-route back to Tampa. United didn't have a flight that worked and so I flew back on a different airline. It didn't occur to me that United wouldn't just send my bag back to my originating airport. Instead they want to charge me to have my bag FedExed to me - a very hostile staff in their baggage department clearly needs a vacation and a reminder that she works in a free country. I have tried to explain my circumstances as being unusual but apparently people book flights now and get off after only one leg because it is cheaper. I'm not sure if I understand this particular phenomenon, but I do understand when a company has blown past their sell-by date and needs to be cut down to size. If customers are using their system in a way that they don't care for - fix your pricing. It is unacceptable to take someone's bag, tell them that you aren't holding it hostage when you are doing exactly that. The airline has no right to insist that I prove anything nor does the airline have any right to penalize customers for not completing their itinerary. United lost a customer over this - I will not fly them again. We live in an age when personal liberties are used as toilet paper by companies that simply amend their terms of service to allow themselves to do whatever they like. United has clearly lost its grip. Fix your pricing, fix your system, grow a few brain cells and stop acting like a has-been monopolist that can't think themselves out of a paper bag - but keep your hands off of me.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Chicago. United agents were extremely rude to my girlfriend. Tried to make her pay $100 for a carry on when she got her boarding pass. Then tried to board her plane was pulled aside for a seat assignment, and then denied her ticket said it was an illegal ticket and gave her seat away. Held her at the gate till she missed her flight and then said they would give her a refund. But when she called to get a refund they said absolutely not. And said she had no options there was nothing they could do. Most pathetic airline Iâ€™ve ever had to deal with. They do not live up to their â€œcustomer commitmentâ€\\x9d', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Honolulu. Every time I fly United I regret it. The cost is not worth the aggravation. They don't even want to help. Asked me to switch lines to check my carry on making me rush to the gate, all while being as rude as possible.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Anchorage to Rio de Janeiro via Chicago / Panama. I bought a ticket flight with United a long time ago and I choose United because of the short duration of the flight and short layover between the flights. Less than 1 month to the trip I received an email with a flight change using Copa Airlines flights. It was added another connection increasing my overall flight trip for more than 6 hours. The trip hours doesnâ€™t make sense: I would arrive in Chicago at 11 am but my next flight time would be at 9 am from Chicago to Panama, which means I would arrive in Chicago 2 hours late for the next flight. (they sent it to me - company huge mistake with time sense) I called to customer service to try to fix it and they offered another ticket with 16hours of a layover or the reimbursement of the ticket! How I would find another international ticket in so short notice with a good price and good conditions of time flight? I asked to talk with the manager that was not flexible at all and said that I must accept the conditions of the changes otherwise the only thing they can do it is reimbursement. However, that was not a simple change condition... that was a huge mistake with time flight. I couldnâ€™t get a plane that had already left because I flight that they added. I would miss the connection because of a United airline mistake. The manager was not doing anything to try to fix my problem and she said that: â€œ in my end, there is no more I can doâ€\\x9d. I had to accept their change offer conditions resulting in a more 7 hours of increase in my overall flight trip. By the end of the call, the manager was impolite on her manners with an angry tone of voice. I travel a lot as well as my family and this has never happened to me before with the other airline's companies. This will be the last time I travel United. I donâ€™t want this kind of problems for me in the future.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orange County to Oklahoma City via Houston. I landed in Houston and before I even got off the plane my connecting flight to OKC was cancelled. Everyone I talked to that worked for United was rude. I was told I was automatically booked for the next day late afternoon which was unacceptable. No one would help except one agent who got me on standby, but I was #20 on a full flight. Clearly I didnâ€™t make it. Then I found out 2 people were ahead of me on standby and they already had a confirmed ticket on a later flight. Now tell me how they should take priority over someone whose flight was cancelled. I ended up buying a one way ticket on American. I will never fly United or recommend them again. Houston is supposed to be their hub so tell me why they canâ€™t enlist another plane to make up for all the cancelled flights. Even flying today everyone I came in contact with was rude. Iâ€™m talking about the people behind the counters at the Houston United gates. The only thing they did right was release my luggage to my daughter at OKC while she was waiting for my American flight to land. My cancelled flight was #6295', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Las Vegas. I am a 1K member due to my living proximity to EWR. My last 3 flights were over 1 hour late they have discontinued premier access so my wait time through security has been over 45 minutes and still every flight is full. I have finally signed up for Delta status match as this flight has really pushed me over the edge. Flight 2 hour delay, sat in front of door waiting to get on for 15 minutes because cleaning crew missed items. Food is disgusting and cabin staff attitude is worse than passengers that have suffered another disappointment. I travel every week or minimum 2 x per month i pay for first class as there upgrades as useless and never able to redeem and still suffer. I know my words wont change anyone's mind before buying a ticket on this airline the CEO should be embarrassed to represent such a horrible company.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Newark. We ended up on this flight as our original flight which was to Montreal via air Canada was cancelled at the very last minute without warning and we had to rebook. We arrived early boarded on time. It wasnâ€™t until we got on the tarmac and the plane was still sitting. Apparently the captain had to some systems checks and something didnâ€™t pass. Once passed about an hr had lapsed fuel has been burned so we had to return to the gate to refuel. It took a total of 2 hrs for the process and we had a connecting flight to Italy and only had a two hour layover. All the while the flight attendants could not reassure that our connecting flight would be held for us to catch. There were issues with this situation from the get go. The thought of a cancelled flight was something I understand is normal but at the 11th hr was not appropriate notification to customers. For customer safety, one would think that the pilot both the ones on the previous flight and current flight should have some system of checks for the plane well before we get on the plane for the aforementioned safety and efficiency. All this added stress to customers could have been avoided if there was a better system of checks and communications going out to customers. After all this, this was the 2nd significant incident I had with this airline and doubt I will ever travel with them again in my lifetime if I had a choice.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | El Paso to Houston. Truly a poor airline service all around. The plane from the small airport to Houston smelled filthy and had tiny seats, even for a petite female. I opted for the cheapest option for my flight - basic economy, which was a huge mistake. They did not authorize changes, cancellations, or adjustments at any time immediately after purchase. After waiting on the phone for 20 minutes, I was greeted by a customer service representative who basically just told me thereâ€™s nothing they could do and maybe try contacting my ticket issuer, Capitol One. I had applied some reward points to deduct about $93 from my over $400 round trip ticket from Killeen TX to El Paso TX. I contacted them only to be told that United is the only company authorized to make changes to my flight itinerary, which I can only imagine the original United rep has already known (or should have at least). Essentially she had just pointed fingers elsewhere to avoid problem solving. We are also not even allowed a carry on item at this rate, which seems completely unreasonable. The price of their economy tickets are not comparable to other airlines such as Frontier or Southwest, which makes it more confusing as to why they are so strict (the fact that I regularly use cheap airlines should indicate that my standards are not high to begin with, I just like affordable travel). On the same token, even if I had paid a higher fare to be able to carry on items and adjust my flight, I still would be sitting in the same dingy aircraft crammed next to the person in the seat next to me. I would almost be insulted that I bothered to pay the $50-100 more for the same poorly maintained vehicle. The aisles in my first flight were so narrow that I was shoulder checked every time someone walked by, while still shoulder to shoulder with the gentleman next to me. The seat did not recline either, so I sat there, sitting up at 90 degrees, being bumped for an hour from both sides. Furthermore, their WiFi is both overpriced and limiting. To be fair, I should have read more carefully where it states â€œsteaming not supportedâ€\\x9d. I could not watch Hulu or Netflix with the $9.99 for 1 hour of WiFi that I paid for. Instead Iâ€™m using it to write this review, while on my return flight that was delayed for 2 hours this morning. Instead of watching the new Game of Thrones episode on the WiFi that could have paid for a meal, I will be sitting here with my elbows and knees completely tucked in uncomfortably, again, as to not be sitting on top of the man next to me. Overall, this airline is grossly overpriced for the lack of services it affords itâ€™s customers. Will not ever be flying United again unless the military books it for me.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Sacramento to La Guardia via Chicago. I travel quite a bit and this was the single worst experience I've ever had. I was with a group of people going to New York City, and we planned to arrive there in the morning, leaving plenty of time to rest, get lunch and dinner, and then see Mean Girls on Broadway. We got to the airport at about 9pm, made it to the gate to see that our flight had been delayed until 8am the next day. It was because one person called in sick. The airline did not get us a hotel for the night, so we slept at the airport on the incredibly uncomfortable couches because the tile floor, which would have been more comfortable, was too cold and we weren't even allowed through security to the gate so we were in front of the doors that were opening and closing, with loud announcements coming in every minute or so. United airlines gave each of us three $10 meal vouchers in compensation that were ultimately useless as we did not have a long enough layover in Chicago to buy anything. We missed Mean Girls, and received no refund. Thanks, United!\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Newark to Buffalo with United Airlines. Very rude staff at the boarding gate. This is not the first time. Very disappointed. I would never recommend any of my friends and family to this airlines. No respect for customers. They have to teach their staff to respect customers first.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to Newark. Travel with United Airlines is always getting delayed. This is just the 3rd instance in a row. United doesnâ€™t care about customer service or satisfaction. United just want to make money and cut down the cost at the expense of customer satisfaction and happiness. United executives just care about how much millions they make at the expense of the customers and the employees. I wish a better airlines available like Singapore or other airlines who cares about customers.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Rochester to Newark. I asked to have a seat reassignment the attendant told me they won't even look at it then the flight is late because the airport did not have a power pack ready to power up the plane.. Horrible customer service and performance by United to meet their obligation to their customers.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | I was supposed to leave from Houston to Rio de Janeiro on April 20th, 10 pm. It is April 21st, 2:30 pm and I am still at Houston airport with all the other passengers trying to get an extra flight to replace the one they just cancelled: \"We\\'re very sorry to let you know that your flight (UA 129) on 21 Apr. has been canceled because of a lengthy maintenance delay and regulatory crew scheduling restrictions. Check out your options on the United app or united.com under Saved Reservations.

Besides this problem, crew members have been rude to people that were just trying to get information. I am a loyal customer but now I don\\'t even know what to be loyal for... if a service company charges more expensive prices and you still buy it, is because you trust on receiving a better service... not what I have seen today. Very frustrated and disappointed.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to San Francisco. Service was very bad and aircrafts was very dirty. Due to some delays on another airline I was rebooked to return back to Tampa same day. I did not make that flight because of the incompetence of the ground staff in San Francisco. Very rude and did not really care to listen. Same day inbound flight horrible aircraft outbound could not even make it because of United staff. 25 years of flying over 200.000 miles per year. Never seen an airline this bad.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Hartford to Denver. First class is not very classy. After boarding the attendants were nice, offered a couple of drinks. Then breakfast one option cereal and yogurt. After takeoff and â€œBreakfastâ€\\x9d we had another 2.5 hours with no beverage or snack service! And letâ€™s not forget no wi-go! Thank god for solitaire. Worst first class flight ever!!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Burlington. I was supposed to arrive at my destination 18 hours before my life changing interview giving me plenty of time to be prepared. But of course, with United, I ended up landing in Boston at 12am (not Burlington, Vermont), and had to rent a car ($312.07 receipt attached, wasnâ€™t planning on renting) to drive to 3.5 hours to Stowe, Vermont to make sure I got to my interview by 9am. I slept for 2 hours before my lifetime interview because United lost my bag and I didnâ€™t have my suit. So, I had to buy a full suit for my interview ($150) an hour before my interview. This truly couldnâ€™t be any worse of a situation and impacted my personal life dramatically. I made it to the interview, but 2 hours of sleep and cheap temporary dress clothes was devastating. No bag, cancelled flight due to maintenance, no flight to my destination, renting a car, driving hours after midnight, all could have been avoided by United. I would also like to add I still donâ€™t have my bag and Iâ€™m flying back home. Iâ€™ve gone this whole trip with no clothes, no toiletries, nothing. United needs to fix this.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Newark to Delhi. This was first time i booked international flight for my family through United Airlines it was really worst experience i ever had with any airlines.The flight UA82 was scheduled from Newark to Delhi at 9:50 PM on 16th April 2019. We went to airport with 2 small kid (1 infant) and really struggled for checkin, United airlines agent were really arrogant and not responding properly on query, anyway i spent 1 hour and 30 minute finding what to do and agents sending me here and there. At last we have been asked to be on a long queue to get help, finally after another 40 minute on queue we have been told that flight is cancelled and that is the reason we had difficulty in checkin through kiosk. Wow this was terrible, i had to drive 60 miles to reach airport and now i hear flight is cancelled, there was no prior intimation on cancellation of the flight. Thankfully i kept few days of gap for my next flight from Delhi to Raipur. I was given only one option of connecting flight next day which i had no choice of denying so accepted. I really never thought United Airlines is going to be such a terrible experience. Now onwards UA would be a last option to fly with.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Dallas. Well, United just lost a customer since 1981. Tried to check in online (and via phone, and with a live human) and was told that one cannot check in without a checked bag. In other words, there is a $30 fee for checking in online. Goodbye, United. It's been fun!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Oklahoma City. We were told that we had to check our carry-on luggage because it wouldnâ€™t fit in the overhead cabin. Once boarded, we saw the limited space and were shocked. The aircraft was very warm, small and uncomfortable. There were no plugs for devices nor were there any screens to view tv/movies. I was blown away with how little space there was, the lack of amenities and how cramped the flight was for the money we paid just to be on the aircraft. How is it we are now spending more and more money these days, yet going through hoops just to fly and getting less? There was little arm or leg room, no WiFi, there was water but no soap in the one restroom available, my armrest would not go up and the compartment holding the magazines was broken. I will think twice before boarding another United aircraft again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Chicago via Kansas City. I have been a longtime miles plus and explorer member. I booked flights on United for my wife and son from Dublin to Kansas City through the United website using my account. This is one of those code share flights where Aer Lingus carries out the first leg and United, the second. The Aer Lingus flight was delayed and my wife and son missed their connecting flight. When at the United customer desk, they were told that it wasn't their problem. There were no more flights to Kansas City that night and they would not arrange accomodation. Instead, United made a ten year old and his mother sleep in the airport, and I still had to drive three hours to collect them at another airport, unless they wanted to remain in the Chicago airport for another day. I am astounded by the service provided by United. I will never book with them again and will take steps to cancel my explorer credit card with them.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Waynesville. Staff was cold and unfriendly while being vague with directions and an unwillingness to help or answer questions clearly. They cancelled our flight and we were forced to stay in Chicago for 2 extra days without any vouchers for food or a hotel. There is not enough staff to address the customers who have paid lots of money for their poor service. Do not fly United Airlines. Ever. Unless you enjoy total chaos, poor service, and anxiety. I will never fly with them again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Frankfurt via Chicago. Worst ever customer service seen in my life. It took 2.5 days to reach my destination with each and every flight disruptions. I trusted Star alliance but seems to be they have lot of communication gape between airlines which gave me a nightmare.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | We were shocked at the lack of customer service given to us by the airline attendants going from San Antonio to Denver for a connecting flight to Hawaii and LA to San Antonio coming back. An attendant coming home literally told my husband on our honeymoon we shouldn't of purchased these tickets if we wanted to sit together (making the assumption we are broke because we paid for economy tickets). I also observed the flight attendant turn down a mother and child to sit together. On the flight from San Antonio to Denver we asked to sit together for our honeymoon trip and all staff including the captain stated we could ask around but they would not help us. We ended up sitting separately on both connecting flights. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed in United Airlines punishing economy class fliers by splitting them up. We will not book with them again and will spread the word about their poor unprofessional practices .\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Baltimore to Chicago. Worse customer service I have seen. Paid to have an assigned seat to be next to a companion in a flight and without notification of the airline changed the seat 3 times. When I called to try to rectify the situation the lady on the he phone kept repeating that she was not able to help and that the seats were transferred to the airport. I explained that I needed to be next to this person due to panic attacks and they disregard it and refused to give me a number to call.', 'united airlines Not Verified | This was the worst flight experience. The flight was delayed twice, due to weather, which is understandable. However, the app did not accurately update flight changes. The gate agents refused to address customer concerns in a timely and accurate manner. Finally, the jet walk was broken when we arrived 2 hours late to LaGuardia. Once again, the staff seemed unconcerned with the fact the a jet if tired, late customers was inconvenienced again by their incompetence. I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My family and I are traveling from Fresno to Honolulu via Los Angeles.

They could have call, text or e mail us.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Los Angeles. Zero customer service. I had to waste 32 minutes of my time to reinstate my ticket that they canceled. I was lucky the flight was delayed for an hour otherwise I would not have made it home to my kids.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I had a flight from San Antonio to Zurich via Washington. We got on the plane but they were driving us around the airport for 2 hours because of the storms in other parts of Texas. Finally we had to leave the plane and go back to the terminal, because the crew could not work more regarding to the regulations. We missed our connections on Washington, so we had to wait in the line til they rebooked the tickets for everyone. This woman rescheduled my flights so that I had to change one more time in London with only a half an hour time time span. Also the first flight from SA to Houston became critical because of the delay again. So I made them to rebook my flight again. So I had to stay one more night in SA, and leave 6 am at morning to New York. There I will have to wait more than 6 hours and finally get to Zurich a day later than i planned. Horrible experience. I'll never use United Airlines again! They do not cover any of my additional costs, but saying with big smile, that it was not their fault, but I can blame the bad weather.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Orlando. This is a disgrace. Waiting at the Airport from 12pm today. Got on the assigned flight which was suppose to leave at 4:05 pm had a technical difficulty. Was kept on the flight for two hours only to find out we have to deboard. No crew member knew what the status is. An hour later found out flight got canceled and was given a different flight and gate. Once boarded that flight at 7:30pm only to find out that this flight has a technical difficulty also. An hour later was announced that th iui s flight was canceled too. Its now 10:15pm no news yet. This is a disgrace. I have been flying United for a while, this is my third round trip just this year.

My family and me are heading for the spring break to Europe. Due the delay of the flight from ORF to IAD this afternoon, Apr 12th, we missed our flight to VIE for 5 minutes. The next connection even with an additional layover via FRA has delayed us for about 12 hrs and we had to wait with our 7-year old daughter for about 5hrs in Dulles. Hence, I had to feed our family for $80 - and weÂ´re starting much too late in order to catch with our people, who are waiting for us. Asking at the United desk at the C1 gate dealing with the flight to FRA departing at 22.20, UA932, for an upgrade as compensation or a voucher, we were rejected. (\"Because we don\\'t do that with kids\"!) ItÂ´s not the first time that United is performing like that. My frustration is manifest and paramount. IÂ´d pay double the price, if there would be an alternative to your airline. One thing is certain - IÂ´d do everything possible to tell the people what a creepy airline United is.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Los Angeles via San Francisco. The worst company and the customer service that I have ever experienced. Was charged for the ticket that I persuaded more than I was supposed to, even though the e-ticket was showing an original price. Called the customer service they advise me to go to a bank. Went to my bank, they provided me with all the official information that proves that I was charged more than it was saying on the e-ticket from united airlines. Called the united airlines again, we had an hour and 30 minutes conversation 3 ways with my bank and the United Airlines company itself. They denied the fact that I was charged more, I asked them to provide me with an email where I can send all the proven documents with an official stamp of the bank that I was charged more than I was supposed to. It never happened. Very disappointed. I canâ€™t refund the ticket, I canâ€™t have the extra money that I paid back, nothing. Would never recommend anyone to use this company.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Burbank to San Francisco. Zero customer service. Was forced to use 2x do to last minute flights and both experiences were horrible. Forced us to check a bag when originally not notifying us that only one under the seat carry on was allowed. First experience we were on the phone for hours trying to get a flight when we had a international non refundable flight the next day. They refused to give a family member first class when they cancelled their crew due to overworking them. They refused to book him on another flight and as a result we lost 2500 because he could not travel internationally. Never use this airline. There was plenary of cabin space when we entered the plane however they insisted on charging us to check my tiny luggage. If you want to be screwed over use this airline.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Denver to Los Angeles. I just wanted to sit next to my husband and they changed his seat to the back when we were originally sitting together! I even asked them to make sure we were sitting together before they changed him. We ended up sitting separate because of such incompetent staff! Worst people ever! When I complained they didnâ€™t even care!', 'united airlines Not Verified | Chicago to Duluth. Worst experience ever: I normally donâ€™t write reviews but I need to vent about this. The flight to my destination (Chicago) was alright. Not the nicest situation but I was okay with that. However, going back was a complete mess. There was a gigantic winter storm occurring in Minnesota, which was where my return flight was scheduled to go to. I assumed that there would be delays, which there were, but they didnâ€™t inform us of this until after our flight was scheduled so I spent all day at the airport just waiting for my flight to get delayed. At this point they rescheduled it for the next morning, which was dumb because the storm was more than likely not going to be done until 1pm the next day, but because it wasnâ€™t large enough of a delay they werenâ€™t going to supply us with hotel rooms or discounts of any sort. Instead, they offered us cots to sleep on in a hallway of the airport. I, being a broke recently graduated college student, took them up on this offer and I really wish I hadnâ€™t... the cots were stained all over and I guess they couldnâ€™t shut the lights off in the hallway or the loud announcements that shout things like â€œno smoking in the airportâ€\\x9d because those are all very necessary to hear at 2am... so as you can imagine I slept horrible waking up every 20 minutes to one of their announcements. It also didnâ€™t help that the staff wouldnâ€™t stop talking. They didnâ€™t care at all that there were people trying to rest. I wouldnâ€™t have cared if they spoke quietly or shut doors to the rooms they were in, but they were practically yelling while socializing. And to top everything off I was awoken to a lovely â€œ4am wake up call.â€\\x9d Thatâ€™s literally what they yelled at us as they walked down the hallway and they didnâ€™t even give me a minute to get off my cot until they were standing over me waiting to fold my cot up. So I got up, left, and an hour later at 5am I received a text that my flight was delayed till 1pm. Yep. I slept on a cot for nothing and I now have 8 hours to kill and all I really want is a shower and a bed. Oh and theyâ€™ve changed my gate 6 times. Overall, I felt less like a customer and more like a prisoner at this airport.', \"united airlines Not Verified | This is the second time I have had few options to fly a certain route so I ended up with United. I was not pleased about this from the start. As expected, United Airlines dropped the ball yet again. They tell me on the same day as my flight that my flight has been delayed nearly three hours because of a mechanical issue that occurred several hours earlier in the day (without an explanation as to why this translates into a delay in my flight) resulting in my inability to make my connecting flight. So, they basically say you can fly the next day and offer no form of real compensation for the inconvenience (they never do and will fight tooth and nail not to except perhaps in the form of a voucher for another flight with them). This resulted in wasted money and time on Lyfts to and from the airport and an unnecessary delay in the trip. The smug expression on the lady at the airport's face said everything about how little she cared about the inconvenience this had on a customer. Thanks a lot, United. Whenever someone asks me which airline they should fly, I recommend all of your competitors and recommend specifically that they do not fly United if they can avoid it. You know why? Because United does not care about its customers.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Charged for carryon bags, had to check them. We purchased a package ticket, flying to Vegas on Delta (which is a great airline), we were only here for one night so we brought no personal bags and just a SMALL roller bag each. We got to the airport and were told no full sized carry-on bags. Even though my roller bag fits under my seat I guess they qualify any bag with wheels as a full sized carryon. So we had to pay $30 per bag to check each bag. Had I known I would have A) not flown with United because thatâ€™s. Scam and B) brought a damn backpack for all my stuff. I will no longer be flying with United. My partner and I are avid travelers and itâ€™s unfortunate to cut an airline out if the repertoire said this to myself every time I fly with United I have a horrible experience. Itâ€™s just not worth it. At all.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Los Angeles. First off I will never ever fly via United Airlines again.

I fly over a 100 segments per year and have come to understand and appreciate the issues of the airline. But it began when the flight I was booked on to Houston was going to be delayed for 4 hours and would cause us to miss our connection. I realize this happens. I called Customer service was I was on line with them for 3 hours and 7 minutes, where they proceeded to let me know that the only option I had was to move my flight by a day and because premium economy was full, I would need to go to regular economy.

Today is the first time in years they were invited to the flight deck to say hello to the captain. We still managed to take off in time even with a late boarding due to maintenance. If this is how they function as an airline then they have certainly turned the corner on their previous challenges.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Houston. I have recently flown from the USA to eastern Europe and have flown on a plethora of different flight carriers, but found United to be the least accommodating and the staff was rude. I am a mileage plus card holder and would expect better service to anyone that attends your flights. Hire more respectful flight attendants, they are rude simply for the reason to be rude.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Charlotte. United airlines has to be the worst airline out of all of the other airlines. I mean, terrible! Staff was bluntly rude. Delay after delay. Just the worst possible airline to use. Unbelievable.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to London. Polaris cabin fairly nice, 1-2-1 set up. Had a window seat. FA didn't seem to know where my seat was. Flight left late. Seat reasonably comfortable, food average, drink selection excellent. Flight attendants lethargic and fairly rude. No acknowledgement of my Star Alliance top tier status.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Fayetteville to Seattle via Denver. This was a horrible flight. My seat was like sitting on concrete - incredibly uncomfortable. There was gum all over the chair back in front of me. The staff were incredibly rude and took 30min to complete a simple request. Altogether incredibly disappointing. To top it off the wifi that I paid for did not work and they refused to refund me.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Kahluhi to Denver via Minneapolis. Terrible experience overall. Booked economy class and wasn\\'t allowed to upgrade, even for extra money. Staff very stressed about the \"extra\" wallet-sized bag I carried onto the plane, in addition to my backpack. Plane from Denver smelled stale. Will spend extra money to avoid United in the future', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to San Antonio. Flight has been pushed back 4 times now from original departure time. Every push back, a new lie as to why theyâ€™re running behind. Unacceptable way to do business. Never flying United again if I can help it.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Aruba to Denver via Houston. United has become a complete joke. On original flight, staff were too lazy to pick up the trash more than once during the flight. There was trash in seats and on floor from previous flight, we had no choice but to leave our trash on the plane. Once in Houston they changed our gate at the last minute only to delay the flight for hours to clean plane and to get next flight crew through security. I flew Spirit a year ago and had a better experience. United is nothing more than a budget airline anymore with their new baggage policies and customer satisfaction. Fly Spirit, it is a much better experience for a fraction of the price!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to San Francisco. Worst airline ever. Terrible flight experience. Awful customer service. I will try to never fly United Airlines in the future. I was traveling with my 83 yr old father and the attendants in both Denver and San Francisco were rude and made our flight terrible', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Manchester. Business class check in at Newark is a very poor self service experience - itâ€™s unclear, unhelpful and few staff around to assist. Also travelling business class out of terminal C gives no express lane benefits through security so be prepared for a long queue. From there it improves, the United Polaris lounge is excellent with good food and very comfortable. Showers too. Onto the flight, goodness the aircraft are old. But, they are comfortable and the seats in business are quite good. Food and drinks perfectly acceptable. And ticket cost reasonable. All in all a great option in and out of Manchester to USA which saves on travelling time to London Heathrow for anyone who, like me, is North based.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | New Orleans to Denver. If I could give an airline negative stars I would - this is my single worst experience with an airline. First, they're no bags policy on some flights really does put them in the economy airline category. None of their kiosks we're working and there was only two representatives. I was told that I had to check a bag (I had a very small purse) even though it was backpack sized. Then because it was less than an hour before my flight (45 min) they said they couldn't take my bag that they were making me check. I swear that the attendant acted happy about this. I had to book a new flight for my vacation and I will never be flying United again. I'm perfectly capable of saying when I was wrong but the handling and customer service was crazy - they're trying to squeeze every last dime out of customers.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Houston. This is the absolute worst airline, I have ever flown. I will never fly with this airline again. The customer service is horrible and the staff gave me false information and do not honor their word for the information given.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I am posting this review after several attempts to resolve my issue with United Airlines. We flew from St. Louis to Denver on March 9. Our return flight on March 14 was canceled due to lack of crew, which was understandable given that a major storm had canceled over 1000 flights the day before. Our luggage, however, was flown on to St. Louis without us on a different plane. There were so many flight cancellations and issues that our first available flight home was 3 days later, on March 17. United refused to compensate us for expenses incurred due to being separated from our bags because we do not fit the typical baggage delay case. If an airline recognizes that compensation is warranted for clothes and toiletries when bags are delayed, should not the same be true when your luggage flies on without you? I will never fly this airline again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Reno. Worst experience ever! Flight was delayed for 1.5hr waiting for clearance. Which happens, I guess. But when we landed no luggage. We were informed that our luggage was on another plane & would not arrive until 3pm. We arrived at 11:30am. We were told that our two luggage would be delivered to the home that we are visiting. They said it would go out for delivery at 5:30pm & we could expect it no later than 9:30 pm & if it was not delivered by 10pm to call back. We went & ate & killed time & call back at 4:30pm asking if it was there yet & could be just come & pick it up. We were told No because everyone had already left for the day in baggage claim. By 10:15 no luggage so we called & they said it was still there & we could expect it in the morning. Well it is now 12:30pm & we still have No luggage & no one seems to know where they are or even care.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Santiago de los Caballeros to Newark. My last flight with United Airlines was on March 20th 2019. It was horrible, I went in vacation to D.R and went on JetBlue, really nice. However my come back flight was through United Airlines horrible experience. I had a carry on bag and I couldnâ€™t carry my bag with United Airlines I had to pay almost $50 dollars plus 33.50 for my regular size baggage about $84.00 total. The seats are very tight, no TV and to top it off you get a bird size bag size. The worst airline Iâ€™ve flew. I will keep this on my mind when buying an air flight ticket in the future.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Springfield to Chicago. I have been flying only this airline for a few of years now, mainly because Iâ€™m a member of their frequent flyer program. The experience has been more often then not quite negative. United tends to change gate frequently and a lot of times at the last minute. I have missed two flights because of this and almost just missed a third. Not only do they change gates but they completely fail to alert you about his fact until itâ€™s almost too late and one has only minutes to catch the flight at the other gate. The attendants attitude also is poor and at time down right rude. The seats have hardly enough leg room but Iâ€™m am 6â€™1â€\\x9d so maybe I was just born too talk to be comfortable in airline seats. One of the perks of being a frequent flier member was that you could pick your seats, at least in the economy-section without paying extra. Nowadays if you pick any seat you have to pay extra. Apparently the membership fee is not enough. Bottom line is they are very inconsiderate of their patrons and their staff portrays the companies attitude. If you can afford another airline go to that one, Iâ€™m certainly switching who I fly with from now on. The cheaper flight are just not worth the massive headache anymore.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Really ticked off by agent\\'s rudeness. I was booked roundtrip Newark to Houston on a last-minute Basic Economy ticket. First flight was just fine on American, which allows one carry on in the overhead bin (bag maximum dimensions are clearly spelled out on AA\\'s website) and one beneath the seat. Great, as I only had two small bags. Not so great on my return flight home on United. On checking in at UA\\'s Houston/IAH kiosk I realized the airline\\'s impossibly stingy policy that allows only one small bag under the seat - and nothing overhead. Okay, my fault for assuming United\\'s policy was the same as American\\'s. What really burned me though was the downright surly response from UA\\'s customer service agent when I questioned why I had to pay a $30 bag check fee. He was really aggressive - glaring as he shouted \"my problem was that I was cheap!\" I was insulted, but paid the fee nonetheless. But I\\'m done with United. We\\'ve flown many miles together - too bad United\\'s skies are no longer friendly. From now on I\\'m happy to stick with better carriers American and Delta.', \"united airlines Not Verified | I reserved a flight from San Jose to Boston and the initial flight has cramped seat and experienced heavy lower back pain. I struggled till I got down at Chicago. Now I had a second frustrated experience of connecting flight cancellation. They first messaged that the flight is delayed and then cancelled the connecting flight due to technical issues. My total travel plan screwed up and struck in Chicago. I called them later date and asked for a resolution. The representative held me up wating for 20 mins and finally said that he can refund partial amount. I asked him whether he can put me back on my initial departure location and he again held me waiting and spoke to higher authorities and finally said it's possible and we are at the verge of reserving my flight back to location where i started. I opted for seat preference and the guy told me to wait again and came back after couple of minutes and said that they can't make this reservation at all. We had conversation against the assured resolution and finally ended up with no resolution at all. I spoke to the higher supervisor with whom he was talking before and she said that they gave me misinformation providing me with the refund process application. The whole episode lasted an hr on call due to their ignorance of the customer issue and lack of knowledge and professionalism in whatever they do. I ended up missing my flight and appointments sheduled and with total loss of time, money and peace of mind. They don't want to resolve customer issues as far as possible. Their flights are junk. They have no professional knowledgeable staff or Representatives. I will never ever travel again with United Airlines!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Spokane. On the flight. All passengers onboard. 8pm Friday night and everyone would just like to be home. Waiting on the runway for late passengers. In 30 years of flying, hundreds of flights, I have never had an airline hold a plane for me - even when on a late connection with the same airline. Who is so special that they hold a flight 30+ minutes for them? The airline either needs to wait for late passengers every time or never. This experience made me want to never fly this airline again - I have a lot of choices.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | SeaTac to Houston via Pensacola. Bought economy ticket. Assumed i would not be able to bring a bag on because the overhead bins would have limited space. Ended up having to pay to check my backpack because of dimensions, meanwhile it would have easily fit under the seat in front of me or one of the numerous empty overhead bins. They only didn't want me to be able to bring a bag so they could charge me 30 dollars flat for checking a backpack.. This increased the cost of my ticket by roughly 15 percent. Saw this happen to at least 3/5 of the other people check-in in near me. Added check In time, possibility of missing bag, and pickup time on far end of my flight for no reason. Scam ticket prices for the basic economy so they can attempt to compete with legit airlines on price. Will not be flying with this company again. Their prices are basically false advertising. Feel bad for their customer service employees, cause I'm sure the line level eats all the stress of the CEO/execs eating profits.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to London. Thankfully, on this particular flight United's business class was the new Polaris configuration, which is about 100% better than its pre-historic 8-across business class configurations. So, right off the bat, things were moving in a positive direction. And there were few disappointments. Service was friendly, efficient and pleasant on the flight and on the ground on both sides of the Atlantic. United's arrival lounge in Heathrow is such a nice touch! My only complaint would be that the meal was not up to previous standards I have experienced on United's international business class (even in the pre-historic business class). The pre-packaged meals look and taste as though they are - pre-packaged. Moreover, while upgrading the seating environment, it seems UA has chosen to downgrade some of the amenities. For example, the amenities kit is pretty sparse compared to those previously offered. No more plated meals, no more mimosa carts, no wine tastings, no chocolates.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Rome to Newark. On our flight, we had a school of students flying with us and a couple other difficult guests flying with us. All the flight attendants were lovely but there was pne flight attendant who was with us for our flight out to Italy on March 19th, 2019 was so wonderful. Very accommodating, helpful & really did her best to keep everyone happy & safe. The school kids all kept getting up and having a hangout session throughout the plane during the whole flight. I know everyone around me and my fellow friends flying back home were very displeased with them and how uncontrolled they were by their chaperone. As I imagine most passengers felt on this flight with them. The attendant was very helpful in trying keep the rest of us content and comfortable with our flight and all of them. Hope to see her again on my next flight. Side note: never seen a plane be left in the condition I saw today. No respect for the airline. Or the attendants for that matter from a few of the students.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Dallas to Cleveland. The cabin was not clean and I was dismayed to see that the air intake was dirty and possibly had mold or mildew on it. The flight was fine otherwise despite having some repairs needed, the captainâ€™s oxygen mask had to be replaced causing a delay and the engine to run the airplane on the ground was broken so they had to wait to start the main engines at the gate to taxi. Nothing to cause any worry about safety.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Chicago O'Hare. Started getting texts early morning for a slight delay after 6 throughout 7 hours our flight delayed 5 hours and all they offered were free snacks. Our entire day was wasted sitting in Tampa airport waiting for a plane to show up. Their customer service desk was less than helpful and sympathetic.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Papeete. Paid for premium economy for extra 500 dollars round trip for more leg room and narrow uncomfortable seats for 9 hours. Food was terrible. United airlines needs to improve long haul flights, crew services seat comfort to compete with the likes of air New Zealand, Qantas and similar long haul carriers. We are retired and travel a lot, are very leery to use United airlines in the future for such a long flight to most anywhere in the world. Very sad level of crew service, aircraft seat comfort, quality of food services and similar.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cozumel to Oklahoma City via Houston. This airline is horrible. The measly amount I spend on travel isnâ€™t a drop in the bucket to these people and it shows! They know that people have to fly and we donâ€™t have all that many options and they take advantage of that. We were trying to get home to OKC from Cozumel and on our way to the airport from our resort I receive a text that our flight was delayed one hour..ok, no big deal. Get to the airport and I proceed to get three more texts just adding more and more delay time. We end up sitting in the tiny Cozumel airport for 5 hours. Finally get on the plane and the flight attendant is condescending and rude. I asked for headphones and she said â€œno..Iâ€™ve already been up and down this aisle asking 3 timesâ€\\x9d. Thatâ€™s untrue, she asked 1 time and I said no because I didnâ€™t realize Iâ€™d be able to watch the movie, I thought I would have to pay extra to watch. When I realized I was going to be able to watch, thatâ€™s when I asked for headphones. I did it politely and still she spoke to me as though I was a child. We get to Houston and the plane stopped, people thought we were at the gate and proceeded to stand (many people were desperately trying to catch connection..us included), come to find out we were not actually at gate (there wasnâ€™t one available because we were so late) flight attendant comes on speaker and begins to berate those standing up. I get it, itâ€™s a safety issue but a courteous please sit back down, weâ€™re not at a gate would have sufficed. Again, she was condescending, spoke to all of us as if we were idiots. So we ended up sitting on the runway for 20-30 minutes or so and we did indeed miss our connecting flight. We went to customer service (we had already asked to be put on standby for the last flight of the night for OKC) just to be told the later flight was overbooked and we had a slim chance of getting on..my husband had looked on the app and it showed they had three open seats. Told by customer service something along the lines of â€œthose are seats blocked off by travel agents for potential customersâ€\\x9d? And to make matters worse, that all flights were full until 9:30 pm the next night! Putting us in Houston for over 24 hours. So apparently customers who have already paid arenâ€™t as important and customers who might possibly book in the future? Makes no sense! I tried to tell them we needed to get home as we have jobs and kids and I was completely out of blood pressure medication. At that point I just wanted to rent a car and drive the 8 hours home. Asked about reimbursement for having to rent a car, it was a no-go. So we crossed our fingers and went to wait and see if we got on on standby (oh I failed to mention, this flight was delayed as well). We got the last two standby seats thank god, however the plane was very old, very uncomfortable and something kept banging under my feet. Needless to say Iâ€™m glad it was just an hour home. Iâ€™ve never been so glad to have my feet on the ground. I will be using another airline from now on and will suggest all my friends and family do the same. I understand sometimes delays are inevitable (this wasnâ€™t weather related, we were never told what was going on) but the lack of customer service after the fact and the rudeness of the flight attendants is enough to turn me completely off of United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Worst experience ever! 9 hour flight and offered two glasses of water and one ounce of pretzels. For $1400 you would think that in nine hours you would get a meal. But the bigger problem was the return flight from Maui to Chicago on United flight 348. The flight got canceled due to mechanical problems. No hydraulics, I get that, you cannot fly then. But these things happen and there should be protocol in place. 300 + people stood in lines for hours trying to find their luggage, trying to book a new flight or trying to get vouchers. After 90 minutes in line 3, the voucher line, she finally starts handing them out, only to run out of vouchers after three passengers. The luggage line after 2 hours hadnâ€™t moved hardly any people. Three reps from United had absolutely no clue what to do. People who had to stay overnight and needed to retrieve their luggage were sent on a wild goose chase all over the airport. Three hours after the flight was supposed to have left, the agents at the check in gates, overwhelmed and utterly confused, finally started, with three baggage claim checks at a time, disappeared for 15-30 minutes at a time to retrieve 3 bags. It took forever. It was so poorly handled! These mechanical failures can happen but these people should have been kind, apologetic, professional and above all helpful. They were not. A bad situation became out of control and every guest left (some are still there!) frustrated. We are in Maui, so another night is no heartbreak, but $10 vouchers for meals, seriously!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Baton rouge. Had an hour delay out of my control and it put me 16 hours behind, the airline would not help me with a room or food. Even though I paid for all of the insurance possible.

United gets a lot of bad reviews but honestly when it comes down to it they are amazing. I was flying with my choir when I got stuck in the huge Denver snowstorm that caused DIA to cancel all fights and closed most roads in Colorado. United jump into action with everyone working really hard to get all passengers to their destinations as quickly as possible. Even getting my entire choir on a flight the next day. And when most of their passengers had to sleep on the airport floor due to the road closures, United provided re-usable water bottles with small toiletries (things like deodorant, toothpaste, a small tooth brush, ect.) inside. They also gave out United blankets to help keep everyone warm inside of the cold airport. One United women even brought my group games to play while we were stuck. They made the whole process as stress free as they could for us, and even thought they were stressed everyone seemed to be a good mood.', 'united airlines Not Verified | This has been the worst experience ever! First our flight was delayed which couldâ€™ve been ok however when we landed in Houston we literally had 45 minutes to catch our flight. After going through customs then getting in a line one of the reps told us to get out of line to get in another, once in that line the rep there told us we were suppose to stay in the line we just got out of. Once weâ€™ve made it to our gate which was C40 we were told that they already booked us for another flight even though our flight havenâ€™t left yet. So we had to speed walk all the way back to the other end of the airport to gate E. Iâ€™m typing this as I am walking to the gate, hopefully we wonâ€™t miss this one.

I asked customer service if there was anyway I could get my keys to the front or lost and found so he could take an Uber to come get them. They said there was literally nothing they could do unless I went back outside and started the whole process over. I said he isnâ€™t here he has to find a way here.

They said â€œyou could fed ex themâ€\\x9d I said he is stranded at a McDonaldâ€™s while I have my keys 3.5 hours from home. They just kept saying weâ€™re sorry there is nothing we can do. I think this was complete BS. How can someone just not walk to the lost and found where he could pick them up? They wanted me to go back outside to bring them to him, but he was 20 mins away. All in all, I think there was something someone could have done & because of this I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to New York.

I ended up being forced to stay in the airport until my next flight was leaving I had no food or water as I only had my English bank card on me and my bank would of locked my account.

When I boarded the plane, there were plenty of room in overhead compartments. In fact, I've never seen so much empty spaces before! The airline claims it speeds up boarding process (for my $30?). Probably. But after they closed the gate, we stood on runway for an hour and a half. Getting to airport, passing security is already stressful enough, do they have to add to aggregation? Customer service line had 16 people, in 10 minutes I was waiting no one moved, except 3 passengers who gave up and left.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This is the second time in one month that I have had a horrible experience with United and how they run their business. I understand when things go unexpected, but when there is no one to help you, willing to help you and just plain terrible customer service, it makes everything worse. United employees tend to have no clue what is going on and half of them are simply rude. I experienced employees cursing out customers, walking away from customers and straight up leaving customers on their own to \"figure it out.\" Fortunately I was one of the few that was able to get a hotel voucher for my night I spent stuck in Chicago, however when asking how to get there they told me the wrong information for a shuttle or where I needed to go. When I finally got to my destination the next day, I went to pick up my bags in Milwaukee and of course no one was able to be found at the United desk.

When they begin to pass out the drinks and snacks, I watched as the people behind me and in front of me was given these items and not me, but the stewardess looked me in the face twice but didn\\'t offer me anything. So I stopped her and asked her if I missed something, she said no but asked me if I wanted something to drink as I perceived it to mean to purchase a drink and I said no. So I stopped the other stewardess and said the same thing to her and added was the complimentary for certain assigned seats or people and she said no its for everyone - \"did you want something to drink\" again I was asked when other passengers have more than water, now I\\'m stewing because she told me that she served those behind me and in front of me and then going to say maybe you were asleep, how can you say that when you\\'re looking me in the face. -It took everything in me to hold my peace.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Austin. The worst check-in process I've ever experienced and I fly regularly. After leaving vehicle in economy at 5:40am and arriving at the terminal (C) by 6a, I had to find my way to a kiosk through the chaotic crowd which I was not sure if I needed to wait in the line or not. If I didnâ€™t force my way to a kiosk and ask the United associate, I wouldnâ€™t have no what process I was expected to follow. Then forced to pay for my bag ($30 now) which was of carry on size because Iâ€™ve carried on many other flights (see pic of exact similar carry on bags other passengers were able to bring on without paying). I just do not understand when my bag is the same size as all the other passenger bags, I am asked to check in and pay! Then I had to determine that I needed to wait in a line to check my bag, to find out half way through waiting (20 min now), I needed to wait in a bag drop lines and that was the security line. I know what people are thinking, duh dude, but as chaotic as the terminal was it was unclear what was where because you couldnâ€™t see through the crowds. If they had united associates announcing the procedures for everyone instead of having to be asked, it would have been easier for me. I had to seek out help to figure out what to do and announcing myself to other passengers to avoid the same headache I had for their sakes. Then I get into the security line again (45min) which extended the length of the terminal (C) then to follow, another line for the security checks (at least 25 mins). I barely had time to go to the restroom before walking to my terminal to see my flight boarding (flight departed at 7:30a). Absurd! What you had created today was unnecessary stress for your passengers and I will never fly United again after my return. I just cannot do the frequent headaches and added stress I deal with on nearly every one of my flights.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Amsterdam Schipol to Chicago Oâ€™Hare with United Airlines. The usual horrible service and unhelpful staff on this flight. Just asked for some headphones and was told they canâ€™t hand them out until weâ€™re in the air. When I asked why was told that itâ€™s for safety reasons. This despite everyone in the aircraft wearing headphones whilst Iâ€™m having this conversation. Itâ€™s exhuasting having these nonsensical conversations with United staff. They can never give you a valid reason for any of their unhelpful behavior. Itâ€™s like a game where they have to make the flight as miserable as possible for their passengers.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I am so disappointed with United. They canceled our original flight, had us on hold for almost 2 hours (during our vacation), and offered no accommodation. They wanted us to pay over 1000 dollars to get us on a different flight. We finally settled on flying out later, but United did not help with hotel fares, rental car, and any grievance they have caused. They simply did not want to help. We left to go back home 2 days later and had to scramble to figure things out. The people on the phone did not address our concerns. They then proceeded to send us texts about how we should look into changing our flight again. I called them back and again, over an hour wait time just to speak to someone unhelpful. The flight itself did not have screens for entertainment or a meal the way most 4+ hour flights do. United told us last minute right before we took off that we could download the app to get entertainment. Well, after the longest boarding process ever, it seemed pretty rude to let us know right before we take off that in order to get entertainment, we had to download things. They should have let everyone know before hand. The lack of communication, help, and uncomfortable seats have made United the worst flying experience I ever had. Do not fly with them!', \"united airlines Not Verified | Newark to Dublin. As a traveler I would never go through United Airlines after this ridiculous planning. Not only did they have us sit in the plane for almost 4 hours. They gave out one small water to everyone in that time. No one got to even buy beverages or snacks. Did I mention they didnt even have a pilot to fly the plane? Thank you all so much for wasted over 4 hours out of everyone's trip as well as 3 more hours from MSP airport to Newark. Save your money and your time!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Eugene to Denver. United now has a class called Basic Economy which is one class below Economy. You can not check In online under basic economy unless you check luggage for $30 each flight. This policy makes for long lines at the ticketing counter due to those who use to not check bags as a time saver. The long lines at the ticketing counter makes it so United does not have enough manpower to check in customers that use to bypass the line causing new added congestion. I have flown 11 flights with United in the past 2 months therefore I am deciding to avoid United until they change the policy to speed up my travel plans in the future.', \"united airlines Not Verified | My flight out of Vail, CO was cancelled the night before because of the blizzard that came thru the state. Working with Expedia and United, I was able to have my flight changed to Aspen. Unfortunately, my flight was cancelled another 4 times because of weather. Finally, all airports were shut down for the rest of the day. I was notified about each cancellation. I started out making changes on the app. But, once the airports were closed, it became too complicated to do that way and I needed to speak to an agent. I spoke with someone, on the phone, who was very emphatic to me and did whatever she could to help me. Since I was so close to the Aspen airport, I decided to go in and speak with an agent in person to make the changes. The man I spoke with was so helpful. I was switching from date to date, around to different airports, and went thru a lot of times. He had no problem spending as much time with me as I needed. He was also able to accommodate whenever I needed to change it to. This was a frustrating and exhausting 12 hours that was made much easier by everyone that I dealt with. Weather is out of everyone's control but, it feels so much better with the help I received.\", \"united airlines Not Verified | San Francisco to Portland. The only thing United's wifi is good for is writing a bad review. They have terrible inflight entertainment because they expect you to pay $10.99 for barely any workable internet connection and require you download a plug in to enjoy movies/tv but make it absolutely impossible to find. So then you're stuck with no entertainment options at an unfair rate. To put in perspective, that's more expensive than my monthly Netflix fee. In addition, unlike other generous airlines, they require you pay for absolutely everything. You might think you are getting a bargain flight, but when checking out, you are required to pay extra if you want to sit with your family, extra if you want a carry-on rather than offering it complimentary, and they charge you for everything else offered on the plane. Surprised they don't have someone waiting outside the door demanding money for toilet paper. Bottom line, it is worth paying a bit more upfront to fly with a different airline than being surprised halfway through your trip when the expenses add up and you're feeling more and more agitated by the second. Cheers and don't fly United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Orlando. Flight attendant was very rude. He wanted my husband and I to pull up our seats for take off and he didn\\'t even ask politely. It was like he was talking to 2 kids. \"Come on come on pull up your seats\" while he made hand gestures that are used for toddlers. He got even louder to attract an audience. Flew many times and the flight attendants were always so polite but this attendant today, I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed. There are a lot of kids on this flight and maybe he was aggitated because of the kids. Worst experience ever. Please coach him.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cabo San Lucas to La Guardia via Houston. This is the worst airline ever. The lines were miles long at Newark just to go through TSA. We were a group of 8. Airport staff had to assist us in skipping the line just to make our flight that was boarding in ten minutes. We were literally on a 2 hour line. Our flight was empty because 80% of the passengers missed the flight. On our way back home, we left Cabo and arrived to Houston to connect to get to NYC. Once again Bs! The flight landed and we were on the tarmac for a while waiting for space. People were telling the flight attendants to make a announcement to let the people that have connecting flights off first. They made the announcement last minute, and it didnâ€™t help because once again everyone missed their flights. There was a long line to get a receipt for customs. Then we had to get our bags and recheck them. Houstonâ€™s airport needs a AirTran because we ran for miles just to reach our gate. Of course the flight left everyone behind. Thereâ€™s was only one flight leaving back to Newark. Only two people from my party of 8 was able to fly standby. 80 percent of our flight had to stay the night in Houston. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this before. I would rather fly with Spirit or Southwest! You get to the airport hours before and still miss your flight. I have no idea why they would book connecting flight that they know, thereâ€™s no way possible you can make the connecting flight. How can you make it from one flight to the next and make it through long lines and tsa/get bags/recheck bags/run miles to your gate.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to San Francisco. I was very disappointed the Basic fare did not include standard carryons, and I had to pay extra $30 and had to be check in only and not able to bring on the plane. Other airlines basic fares still include carryons as always. But United decided to wanna be like Frontier. I will avoid flying with United again and would advise others to do the same.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Houston to Orange County. Put us on plane to wait over an hour for crew. Why put us on plane only to sit without a/c? Ridiculous. The stewardesses were clueless and couldnâ€™t give us updates. Disappointing for sure.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cincinnati to San Antonio via Chicago. United delayed flight from Chicago to Austin by 5 hrs for vessel repairs. United customer service at Chicago was not helpful at all to help arrange another flight. I had an appointment to see a medical specialist and had to reschedule Medical specialist appointment. United Poor maintenance and inspection practices cost will cost me nearly $500 for addition hotel charges, rental car charges, and flight modification charges. United airlines made no offer of attempt to rectify the situation. I will not use United airlines in the future. I can understand sometimes delay issues arise in the airline business, however United Airlines customer service failures should not be overlooked.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Los Angeles to Richmond via Chicago. I should have read the reviews before booking the flight. Pretty much Everything I read has happened to me on this one flight. Late takeoff causing missed connection, very rude gate attendant, while in Chicago the gate was changed three times. Itâ€™s been a total nightmare. I will Never fly on United ever again. Iâ€™d rather pay more money for another airline than fly on United again. It is just that bad.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Raleigh to Chicago. Flight was to leave at 12:30 and itâ€™s 4:45 and we are still waiting. Not sure if we will make our connecting flight and employees donâ€™t seem to care. I am very disappointed.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Newark. The delay on this flight was unconscionable. The First Class food choices were awful and on this flight the second choice was not even available. Economy passengers were allowed to use the First Class restroom which limited their accessibility and it is something First Class passengers pay more for. This is a recurring theme on this route.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I have been flying from Frankfurt to Greenville over Washington. My flight to Greenville had a 3+ hour delay and was then cancelled an hour before the flight due to â€œweatherâ€\\x9d. First of all the weather is fine so thatâ€™s inaccurate but iâ€™m not an expert on that so i guess i canâ€™t really judge that. However customer service at the Washington Dulles airport was rude and dismissive and couldnâ€™t give me basic information on driving distances. I had to look it up myself and i feel that this is inadequate at best. They would not give me an overnight stay so i had to rebook my flight over to Columbia SC which is a great inconvenience for me and my ride. I will not be flying with United again, since they have proved to not be worth my money.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Detroit to Newark. The incompetence of this company is staggering. Kept us on a flight for an hour and a half trying to fix the plane instead of just putting us on a different plane. Deplaned us and scattered us everywhere to try and rebook flights. I rebooked my flight and didnâ€™t get to the counter before the loaded everyone. By the time I got my bag switched over (they have to manually do it through radio instead of having an electronic system) they overloaded the plane and I missed that flight as well. Finally I had to rebook again on 2 connections having me traveling the entire day! Then to top it off, they give me food coupons that werenâ€™t even accepted by McDonaldâ€™s! Unbelievable.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Newark. First and last time on United. I purchased a basic economy ticket. If only I had known. When I went to check in for my return flight tomorrow, I was given an option of getting a voucher if I took a later flight. I would have taken a later flight, as something has come up where I'm visiting, but it would have to have been a bit later than the three flight options presented. I then made the mistake of calling customer service to see if they would help. It only made me more aggravated. You see, even though they have extra seats on the flight I would have gladly taken to free up my seat on their overbooked flight, I was told not only would I not be able to do that, I would be charged a bunch more money - I'd mention the amount here, but I could not hear the supervisor and she seemed annoyed when I asked her to repeat what she said. (I was calling from a good landline, not sure what they use over at UA). I don't envy those customer service reps. I would not want to be representing UA. I have since Googled about them and their customer service and business practices seem to be lacking, to put it mildly.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Tokyo. Requested for window or Aisle seat. Itâ€™s ok to have them say No to me. But staff were very rude and they donâ€™t want even help, although they got seats. They said I need to pay additional $230 for purchasing the seat and price is ridiculou.', 'united airlines Not Verified | 50 min to check luggage. Long lines, first needed to get ticket then wait in 2nd long line to hand over bag. 1 person checking in. Plane delayed. Flight attendants rude to those \"in the back\". Attendant at boarding also rude. Did not get regular status but found it online. Pilot was nice and tried to be accommodating. Had to pay extra to sit next to my husband.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Columbia. United is by far the worst carrier I have ever flown and done business with. Over the past 15 yrs they have screwed our flights on every occasion! From missing flights to losing our bags for over a year. We have limited opportunity because of the small airport we fly out of. We will drive to a major hub in Charlotte to avoid this airline going forward. I highly encourage anyone looking to fly to avoide United Airlines as well.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | QRO - Queretero, Mexico - to IAH Houston Texas - 2 hour flight seated in a United Arlines - Embraer 175 operated by Mesa Airlines. The seats had 0 - zero - padding and likened itself to sitting on a wooden church pew. I am not exaggerating. Literally no padding. If one inch (1\") of padding was added to each seat, the plane would lose 2 rows of seats (8 seats) for that flight segment. Corporate greed couldn\\'t be worse (of course it could be, but you get my point). See you, United Airlines, never again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I was flying from New Orleans to New York at 330pm and 3 Uunited pilots showed up 3+ hours late â€œdue to trafficâ€\\x9d (although everyone else arrived with out an issue for their flight). As you could imagine, lots of people to miss their connecting flights. When I called to get a new flight home I was told there werenâ€™t any to take me to New York until the following day at 2pm. I had to stay in a hotel and was not given my luggage. The United staff I talked to about my hotel fought with each other for 15 mins before helping the customers and then when I got to the counter the lady â€œhelping meâ€\\x9d answered a phone call from her son on her cell phone and proceeded to talk to him while I stood there at 11pm waiting for a hotel voucher. The next day the weather was bad and the 2pm, 5pm and 930om were all cancelled. When I finally got home I was told by United that my flight would be refund to my card in 7-10 business day. When it wasnâ€™t I called and wrote numerous online complaints. I was then told that I couldnâ€™t be refunded because the flight was used. I told them I was supposed to be refunded and no one cared and Iâ€™m fact they were rude to me when I became upset. Then I was told they would give me a $100 voucher through email in 5 business days but AGAIN I have not received it. They donâ€™t care about your time or your business. I fly very often and the customer service is the worst Iâ€™ve ever experienced.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | New York to San Francisco. After my experience with luggage check-in today, I will not fly with United Airlines if possible. 70% of the UA Staff have no compassion to anyone. Mainly rude, impolite, impatient, made personal judgement before asking and high ego. This is my overall experiences after flying with United Airlines. I am giving my comment based on comparing with my regular airlines like Air Canada, Cathy Pacific, British Airways, Lufthansa and Condor Air. Sometimes, I wonder is this part of the training of United Airlines by offering this type of customer experience or it was simply the culture of UA.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Norfolk to Vail. Iâ€™ve been waiting for 27+ hours now because our flight has gotten delayed a number of times due to what they claim are weather related reasons. Meanwhile all other planes have gotten to their destination of Vail. However, they graciously offered us snacks for our troubles despite our hundreds of dollars in hotel fees and meals. Overall, United Airlines is terrible, you should not fly United.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Never flying United Airlines again. I recently took a trip from North Dakota to Brisbane and back. United managed to ruin over 60% of my flights. It started on my 2nd flight on the way there. The aircraft was delayed for almost 3 hours and did not take off until it should have been landing in San Francisco. Not only that we as customers were given different reasons as to the delays. One said too much rain for 1.5 hours of the delay and the other said too much wind for the other 1.5 hour delay. Landed in San Francisco the ground was barely wet and there was no wind at all. Get off the plane to the overhead pagers telling us that they are going to close the door for the connecting flight to Auckland NZ, mind you 35 passengers were on the plane late from Denver. Plane gets into NZ late miss my connection and have to sit in NZ for 6 hours until the next flight leaves for Brisbane. Return trip stuck in Denver again. Flight crew lied to passengers said it was weather related when in reality they were out of hours. Given 6 hours in a hotel room to sleep and then back to the airport for the flight to be cancelled yet again. Crew blamed weather and that was a lie. The aircraft they were flying was not the proper aircraft to land on the runway in ND as it had no revers thrusters. Same aircraft as the night before so they lied about twice to their customers. Customer Service desk in Denver was not helpful at all. Had to catch a flight out that night to Bismarck which is 3 hours away from home when I should've been flying into Williston 45 mins away. Land in Bismarck and my luggage was sent to Williston and not moved over onto the proper plane. 3 hour drive back from Bismarck and my luggage should've been delivered to my door and yet it was not. Had to make the delivery company deliver it that night like I had informed Williston United personnel that it needed to be. Had to wait almost an extra 2 hours for my luggage to be delivered when it is a 45 minute drive thanks to slow and lazy delivery service. Wrote to Customer Care and they offered me a lousy 300 dollar flight voucher. They offer up to 1k dollar flight vouchers when they over book a plane yet 300 dollars is acceptable to them after wasting 30 plus hours of a paying customers life?? United has 100 percent lost my business and I will make sure I inform everyone I know to choose other Airlines. I am writing this so that if anyone considering flying United Reads this to be aware and to stay away from them as they will Lie to you without issues and they will do absolutely nothing to make things right when they provide horrible service and cause you to be late getting to and from your destinations. They simply do not care as a Corporation about their Customer base.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Austin to Chicago. My 1st flight was delayed and I missed my connecting flight. Ticket agent in Austin on return flight was very rude. Donâ€™t plan to fly United again if I can avoid it.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Austin to Washington. I was harassed on 3 different occasions by 3 different United employees to check the size of my bag. At the 3rd time I made the comment that this is ridiculous and was told because I purchased a basic economy ticket that I would probably continue to be harassed until actually on board the aircraft and also said if I still didnâ€™t like it that she could call a supervisor if needed. I fly first class to Hawaii twice a year and have never been talked to or treated like that ever by an airline strictly based on the status of my ticket. United Airlines you just lost my business forever. If you could treat people like lower class citizens solely based on the class of ticket then you donâ€™t deserve my business or anyone elseâ€™s.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Houston to Los Angeles. Very poor leg room. Snacks? Can they spare the Tiny bag of infant sized pretzels? Lol Iâ€™d be embarrassed to pass them out. My flight was 3 plus hours. What happened to In flight entertainment?

United Airlines is the absolute worst airline to fly out of regional airport. Our departure flights were cancelled and we transferred to American Airlines who did a great job getting us to our destination in comfort. However, we ended up getting to Cancun at 1:30 am. We had a great vacation- but unfortunately flew United back. The crew from Cancun were quite rude and when we got to Denver we were delayed again! We paid a bunch of money to this airline and the delays and service is a joke! Go with another airline!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Cancun. I booked my reservation 3 months in advance with seat assignments (2 aisle seats across from each other). United oversold the flight and reassigned our seats to be middle seats, 7 rows from each other. This is totally unacceptable to us and we told the lady that. She said that itâ€™s the best she could do like she was doing us a favor. What a joke on us. Avoid this airline if you can, they donâ€™t care about people.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to New York. Thank you to the kindness of United Airlines employees. On February 13 at 2pm the woman (who was on the VIP line), helped me with respect and kindness and the whole staff at United was great. I was on my 3 month MD Anderson Cancer Center treatment trip. I always fly in on a Tues and leave the next day (Wed) for medical treatments. There is a lot of stress involved with this quarterly trip and I will not go into that. In any event, I was in my Uber on my way back from MD Anderson to the airport and I had to call United because I was having an error checking in online. I actually was taking the trip to NYC instead of Rochester because the flights were to high and because of my medical situation, I am limited financially and need to be very frugal about my trips for my treatments. So I decided it would be cheaper to fly into NYC, vist the night with a friend and take the train the next day! In my call to United from my Uber, we realized that I had booked the trip back home on March 13th instead of Feb 13th. I had never noticed the error. The United employee on the phone said she could book me for a later flight that day but it would be $700 additional dollars on top of my flight. (I purchased the flight insurance because of fear of problems but since the error was on my end, I'm sure I wouldn't have been helped by the insurance.) In any event, I told her I would just talk to someone when I got the airport but she did say they wouldn't do any better!. I was beyond stressed as with the whole medical situation and having to travel alone and the cost the quarterly trips take with hotels and travel etc. I went to talk to the United employee who was at the Airport and when I started to explain what happened, I just lost it. I went to pieces. And I am the type of person who never cries in front of anyone, let alone in a public place.I couldn't even explain what happened I was too upset. In any event, I was treated professional and so kindly at the United desk. This woman and her manger (not sure who was either) really helped me. They worked something out for me and I was able to take the same flight that I thought I was booked on and it just so happened it was somewhat delayed so the timing was perfect. I can't express how much that helped me that day and how much I appreciate how I was treated!!!Thank you United Airlines! If cost permits, I will stay loyal to your airline because of how decently I was treated.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Horrible airline.

We get to the boarding gate and we were told it's 130 for 2 carry on size bags rather than the 60 it would have been out front! We were a bit upset and ready to say forget United from now on but the gate representative did some serious service recovery. She was patient and kind. From now on we will always check our bags in the front and be sure to not get basic economy. We will fly United again. Thank you .\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Ft Lauderdale.

No crew ready to take over flight from Denver to St. George, resulting in delays, resulting in cancelled flight due to weather that could have been avoided by having a crew available to stay on time. This resulted in 19 hours overnight in airport. Next flight to Phoenix, we were sent back and forth to gates 3 different times - again, late flight resulting in running to change terminals in Phoenix to change airlines - made it by 3 minutes.

We were 30 minutes late leaving and when arrived in Denver we waited on the runway for at least 30 more minutes. When finally exiting the plane we were already late for our connecting flight.

Nathan at gate B44 on February 23rd. Did a very good job at keeping me calm and getting us on the earlier flight. I appreciate him very much for his prompt professional attitude when my attitude wasnâ€™t so good. As for the rebooking process, they should rebook to the next available. Maybe the circumstances were not what I was thinking.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Portland. Had my flight out of Denver canceled last night. Granted, they were getting snow, but the other airlines weâ€™re getting flights off. After sitting on the runway for 2 hrs, they taxied back to let us sit at the gate for an hour before they let us off. The flight was now Saturday at 9:30 Had to traverse the entire Concourse twice because they changed gates, only to be delayed again. No weather. They are having maintenance issues with the plane ahead of us. Not anywhere near the first time Iâ€™ve had problems with them.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Boarded plane and waiting for a quick de-ice so we can get underway, storm expected in Omaha. Crew pulls back to gate and re-opens to let late passengers on. Then pull back out, now snowing heavy in CO and we have to go through a full de-ice. Huge delays and very frustrating. Especially, since we rushed once from a connecting flight and they had just closed the gate. Plane was still there but we were told it is against Federal Regulations to open the door once it is closed. Guess we were lied to. Flight prior to this one was to ATL for SuperBowl, due to engine trouble we had to wait a til the next day to fly and missed out on some events. No accommodations made, just â€œnothing we can doâ€\\x9d. I am done flying United.

Do not delay and put people at further risk.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Chicago. United bumped me from the flight on the way to the check in terminal. No one at the airport helped it was all directed to a red phone. Called on the phone they switched to a late flight and couldnâ€™t get any compensation. No miles, no seats nothing. Travel on business every week. Will never use United again!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Green Bay via Chicago. Where do I even start? First in the line at Tampa a question was asked if any military dependents were flying, yes was the answer so we waited with a giant flashing red light while staff looked at us and continued to ignore us and help even others who had come way after us, only to find out that because the military member wasnâ€™t flying it didnâ€™t matter. So we waited for nothing and why is that even a question? Then when printing my ticket the United Employee who had ignored us the whole time grabs the baggage stickers and sets them aside by someone elseâ€™s luggage! Luckily my fiancÃ© noticed and got the attention of a different employee and she apologized for the other employee and put our stickers on in front of us. The flight attendants leaving Tampa were nice at least. We arrive in Chicago, our connecting flight, which we had an hour, but was cut short due to the plane waiting forever, (we as in myself and my 6.5 month old) I change his diaper and put him him the carrier and follow all the signs located in what looks like an area only United flights are...the signs lead me to another security line. Why am I doing this again when Iâ€™m trying to catch a connecting flight? The answer the United employee gave me was that I followed the wrong signs. So here I have to go through this again and at this point my plane boards in 10 minutes and I still have to go through security again just to get to the plane. The TSA lady saw I was in distress and helped me as she asked how long I had. Made it to the plane just in time. Again, the flight attendant was very nice. Get to Green Bay, get off the plane and go to the baggage claim where everyone waited almost an hour before bags even started coming. Guess what? Mine are no where in site (one bag and a car seat). Go to the United Ticketing area and no one was there, multiple people at the other airlines and none at the one I needed. Another employee said she was probably in the back and points to the door, we go and look, I see my bags, no employee. Finally a different flight line employee goes and gets her and she comes out rudely as if Iâ€™m disturbing her. Get my bags and Iâ€™m finally on my way to my destination. I guess since my bags had a car seat they kept them elsewhere, but failed to tell me that? This did not happen when I flew American. But it doesnâ€™t end there. Apparently United chose my bag, the one with the car seat, to go through. Broke a few of my things and some of the bathroom items were out of the bags they were put in to prevent any leaking. My stuff was all messed up and I know they went through them because they left a card saying they did. I'm dreading flying back with them.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Honolulu to Los Angeles via Boston. I have used United services before and I had OK experience. This time was different. Honolulu to Los Angeles: there was no media device on the plane. Overall this is a flight over 5 hours - media device was something expected by all passengers. Couple of the flight attendants were very rude - I understand it's not very easy to work with so many people during a flight but being polite is still part of the service Los Angeles to Boston : this time the flight attendants were super sweet and polite but my negative opinion is based on one of the united rules that I was not familiar with : I ordered glass of prosecco (aware of the fact that I will pay for it ) and I was told that Prosecco could be served only if you are in 1st class! So if you are not flying 1st class you can only order and pay for a glass of chardonnay or cabernet. This might sound silly but what kind of a policy is that. You can't purchase something that is already for sale, because you do not belong to 1st class?\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Charlotte to Washington. Very bad customer service, delayed my flight my flight supposed to leave 6:25 am, I drove 5 hours from where I live to the airport, when I got to the airport they told me my flight was delayed. I told them I have international connection flight, they told me they donâ€™t care I ask for the manager to talk to her regarding this issue, sheâ€™s not even trying to talk to me. Iâ€™m very upset they make me miss my flight, make me stay at hotel at my own cost. Never fly with this airline again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco with United Airlines. My worst flight ever. Very old plane recline and old seat. No TV or entertainment system. Very poor breakfast, very bad service on board. Impossible to relax or work on board.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Chicago to Nashville. Terrible airline. If you value your time do not use United because they could care less about your time. My last 5 flights with United have had 2 cancellations, and 6 delays. Whether itâ€™s maintenance checks or a pilot has not arrived yet they always inconvenience there customers. You pay them in full before you get a ticket then they never give you what you pay for. Never again for me.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cleveland to Newark. Worst service ever. Crammed an entire sold full plane into a small bus after waiting 20 minutes outside to Get luggage in 20 degrees weather. Rude people.', 'united airlines Not Verified | I fly a lot on this airline since it has direct flights to Denver and California, places I frequent. Because of the amount of flying I do, I have a Priority status. On several of my flights this year, entertainment was accessed only via the app on a cell phone. However, the connectivity did not work nor did the plug-ins for power to run a mobile phone or laptop. My last flight was to Denver on a ski trip. Even with my ski and duffle bags marked \"priority\", it took two hours from landing to get my bags. My impression is that UA baggage is understaffed (and also underpaid) where customer service is critical. Counter agents were pleasant enough, constantly apologizing for the delays. I am seriously considering changing my carrier selection. I have had enough.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to Newark. I booked a flight for my daughter to come to visit during her school break. She's 17. They canceled the flight for some mysterious ATC delays that only seemed to affect United, because I was able to book another flight immediately to get my daughter here. Still inconvenienced by 1 night by the way. United tried to book her on a flight 2 days later. Most ridiculous thing I've heard of. Altogether different, but I always said after that video came out of United personnel removing that man forcibly from the plane. that I shouldn't book flights on United anymore. Now I have more of a personal reason. Weather is fine, but couldn't somehow find a way to get my daughter here until 2 days later. No thank you. Not acceptable when other airlines are operating in the same airport with multiple flights and not affected by the mysterious ATC conditions.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Why is it every time I\\'m stuck flying United the flights are ridiculously late. This time, flight 712, EWR to CLE. The departure time scheduled 6:14PM, there were at least 4 changed to the departure time with the flight finally leaving EWR at 10:12 pm. The airport staff were indifferent, no offer of anything, not that I expected much after the last United flight (out of EWR) that we were on. They held us on the plane at the gate for over 2.5 hours before starting to let people off, then telling us \"wait, stay on the plane we were ready to depart\", then spending another hour at the gate before finally pushing back. United, you wont get a third chance.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | As with all budget airlines the staff treat customers poorly. This was disgusting from the booking process. I am a high status star alliance member. But get treated poorly from beginning to end. Their website is a broken mess. I was absolutely unable to make the booking on the website. So I ring in. The price immediately goes up. They force me to do a currency conversion. But then just up the price. And charge me in USD at a higher price. Then I have to pay international fees anyway. But they don't charge me once. 8 times on this one flight I have now had. And the person messes up the booking so bad I have had to make many many phone calls to try fix it. I almost missed the flight because of incompetence of the check in staff. And again I am high status star alliance. So was at the premium check in desk. Came within minutes of missing the flight because of staff incompetence. Didn't get lounge access. Gate staff were surly and uncommunicative. I was trying to find out when the flight would actually take off. To go buy food or visit the toilet. Absolutely unsuccessful. Not bording star alliance customers with United star alliance customers. Entertainment system was broken. Power plug was broken. I paid extra for this SMH charging for services and not rendering. The flight was so late I almost missed my connection. There was absolutely no support from staff to assist me getting to my next flight. Missed the lounge again Same issues at gate. Staff just don't care. With the previous issues I had really hoped to go buy some food and visit a toilet. All of this was quite a way to go. So I sat at the gate. Broken seat. Extremely uncomfortable seat. Broken entertainment. The food. If you could call it that. Was disgusting. It really is the worst food I have seen on international flight. Couldn't even get a snack. I really enjoyed 30 hours without food and barely a toilet Break. United used to be the best. But are now the very worst.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Burbank to San Francisco. For some time now, I have avoided flying United airlines to San Francisco due to their consistent delays. Unfortunately, due to a last-minute change in my schedule, I was forced to change my outbound flight from Burbank to San Francisco, and was stuck with United and their lousy service and small Express airplanes. Thankfully, I was able to keep my JetBlue return flight. I arrived at the airport only to find that the flight was, of course, delayed by an hour. Now I sit here watching the departure time change again and again â€” and not towards the positive. I once again resolve to never again fly this lousy airline.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Denver. I really didn't appreciate that I had to pay for my bags and there was only one personal item was allowed to be taken. The lady told me to put my purse inside my bag pack, so essential I am taking two personal items except now they are heavier so I have to hurt to my back and shoulders so it follows this ridiculous rule of United airlines. Customer service was not good, the way my ticket was printed, it showed my husband's name on both tickets. The guy who checked our boarding pass was extremely rude and made us feel stupid for the way our tickets were printed on the check in computers. Once we got to the gate a part of the seating area was closed and there weren't enough sits for people. There is no lounge that allowes individuals with platinum American Express to use it. The boarding was suppose to begin at 12:25PM and we are still at the gate waiting. Will never travel with United again.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Kentucky to Halifax via Newark. There was no flight crew available for our 6:00 am departure so we were delayed until 8:00 am causing us to miss our connection in Newark which meant instead of arriving in Halifax at our scheduled time of 1:06 pm we would not arrive in Halifax until 10:52 pm. No flight crew, who takes care of the scheduling? Poor performance, not the first time!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Dayton. Was not able to get a boarding pass until we got to the airport since we did not check bags and we're flying economy. Very inconvenient. They appear to not believe Travelers regarding luggage size. The plane was delayed more than an hour due to maintenance. The part had to be flown in. This should not be since Denver is a major United hub. The gate agent appeared surly. I would like to avoid flying United in the future if possible.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Honolulu. Traveling with my wife for leisure, a very rude female at the entrance of the airplane checking the boarding pass, people approaching her for questions and clarifications and she kept on turning them down in a very rude and harsh way rolling her eyes all around as if she doesnâ€™t like the fact that people are asking her questions. The other guy who was assigning the seats kind of he had the same temper and reactions. We were the first there waiting for our seats to be assigned. Checked with the agent and being told just wait and will call you. Flight no. UA1158 scheduled at 8:10, we got called at 7:55 to be informed that we will have 2 separate seats!!! Thatâ€™s ridiculous and poor organization. You can tell from the people talking around no one is happy from the service in general. People were just going with the flow as there is nothing else to do. Never with United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Chicago. I have never encountered a company that wants to suck every single penny out of you, I couldnâ€™t bring carry-on so had to pay to check a bag each way. I was late because of traffic but still before the flight and they told me it was too late to check my bag so they forced me to pay 75$ to get on the next flight or his exact words â€œjust make the bag smallerâ€\\x9d. Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t just make things magically smaller.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Washington DC. Basic Economy: Beware! Even if your bag fits under the seat, the box the airline uses to verify the size of your luggage is smaller than the area under the seat, and United will try to scam you out of $55 at the gate and force you to gate-check your bag -- even if the United attendant at the counter issues you a boarding pass, and has no problem with your bag. That is probably because they only charge $30 at the counter if you decide to check your bag then- but squeeze an additional $25 out of you for any bag they force you to check at the gate. I was stopped halfway down the breezeway, after the gate attendant had already scanned my boarding pass and told me to have a good flight. I was ready to throw away my belongings before I would allow United to scam me out $55. Fortunately, the attendant eventually let me board with my small backpack. I had already spent $17 to UPS some of my belongings home, so my luggage contained even less than when I had flown TO my destination. That was also Basic Economy on United -- and neither the counter attendant nor the gate attendant had had any issue with my backpack for that flight. I will never again fly United. Other airlines have Basic Economy -- but those rules are much less restrictive and those carriers do not treat their passengers nearly as poorly. United treats you like chattel. Also: my ticket was not even inexpensive!!! I had already paid more than I usually do for a ticket to Fort Lauderdale, which was why I had decided not to upgrade from Basic Economy or pay extra for luggage. Expensive ticket, very little luggage allowance, no choice of seat, and terrible treatment by the airline employees in the airport.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Memphis to Vancouver via Chicago. This is just one incident of many that have made me believe this is the worst airlin. Delays, long lines, rude hostesses, and 45min+ wait ties on calls and pulling teeth for legit refunds. Not to mention their non-existent inflight entertainment app is a joke that never works and when it does, feels like it was developed by a 12 year old in a basement, it's that horrible. These guys have made me miss holidays, family events, and so much more. I am sworn to never fly United again. I don't care if I have 3 connections and it takes 3x as long, I will never put myself through the pain and suffering of flying this miserable excuse of an airline.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cancun to San Francisco. The absolute worst airline I have ever flown. I booked these flights months ago and have literally had nothing but problems since. To start out after well over twelve hours between on the phone and Facebook messenger (because god forbid they actually respond on the post they send you a private message to try and resolve. After all this time they said they had everything fixed then when we go to finally start our vacation they changed seats on my wife and I and we were no longer together (oh yeah and they were no help again) next flight was fine from Houston the CancÃºn. Leaving CancÃºn to San Francisco they told us to just keep our Duty Free with us that they didnâ€™t need it. Upon arriving to San Francisco we are told we have to collect our bags and recheck them - and we have to be able to fit 4 bottles of alcohol in 1 checked bag that was already over stuffed. (United also charges for every checked back so no I know why, they get to make another 50.00 for an additional checked bag), after being sent to several different representatives by United personnel we ended up 30 minutes later back to the same one who gladly checked another bag (at that wonderful charge) My United Mileage Plus card will be cancelled tomorrow. United Airlines is absolutely horrible, they will take more and more and give the consumer less each time. Oh by the way CancÃºn to San Francisco left at almost 6:00 p.m. and was 6 hours they didnâ€™t even offer a snack. Avoid them at all cost look around there are much better airlines.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Dulles to Plattsburgh. There were issues with the plane to Plattsburgh NY when arriving on flight from Orlando. We had to wait 5 hours for mechanics to arrive from Detroit. I would think being located in the nation's capital you would have mechanics on site. I'll pass on flying United in the future.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Sydney to Houston. I was told that I could use either the Singapore or Air New Zealand Lounge. I chose the Singapore Lounge and enjoyed the bacon and eggs and Champagne at 9:45 am. The Business cabin seating is 2-2-2, which makes sleeping on one\\'s side and back comfortable but very tight when sleeping on my front. There was an excellent selection of movies to chose from. The salad was very small and no food was served for a good eleven hours--just lunch after takeoff and breakfast before landing. I would suggest more options in the galley. The fasten seatbelt sign came on many times during the flight with the recorded announcement, \"please fasten your seatbelt.\" I was really happy that they did not make announcements in a second or third language which can make sleeping with United very difficult. The flight attendants did a good job and had a sense of humor but it was an older crew. The flight arrived 20 minutes late so I only had 40 minutes go through Immigration and Customs, claim my suitcase, go through security and transfer from Terminal E to Terminal C for my next flight to Orlando, but I boarded with Group 5 and made the flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Rochester via Washington DC. I have never seen some thing like this in my life. They have changed the flight schedule 6 times so far (Iâ€™m still at the airport and still there is a possibility for another change). At the beginning departure from DC was at 8:25 am then changed respectively to 10:00 am, 12:20, 12:40, again 12:20, 12:45 and finally 1:30pm and God knows if they are gonna change it again or not because right now the time is 1:35pm and they have not announced any thing for boarding yet. I think United is the worst airline I have ever seen. This is my last flight with United ever(if it happens at all)', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Kansas city. Given a chance would rate 0 for this airline. I had many bad experiences with this airlines but today was the worst till date. I had an email/text saying that they might experience delays and I called customer service for alternate options and nothing seemed to workout and so I decided to cancel the flight and go ahead with some other options available and they said they wonâ€™t refund until they cancel the flight and they gave me the worst options and made me stay at the airport for almost 12 hours transferring here and there almost 5 times delaying all my plans planned ahead', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My flight was scheduled to leave at 6:30am from Cleveland. We sat on the airplane for 2 1/2 hours with incorrect and misleading updates coming every 30 minutes. We were told that the airplane needed an oil change and that we would only be delayed 30 minutes. After missing my connecting flight I went to customer service and was told if I hurry I can make it to the flight that was still boarding to make it to my destination. Was turned away at the gate saying they didnâ€™t make accommodations for everyone on my previous flight. When I expressed that I was directed to that gate from customer service I was told that the previous person was mistaken and I was going to have to wait until 2:45. Putting me at my final destination 5 hours behind schedule. Making me miss my ride and events planned ahead of time. Board and crew were nice on the first flight but all of the misscommunication between what was going on while we sat on the tarmac and once getting to the Houston airport was awful.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Oklahoma City to Washington. Today I had the seemingly bad luck of flying with United. After getting to the airport I found out my flight was cancelled. Once I found out I went to the nearest United ticket counter but on the way ran into a gate agent who said \"you should have known the flight was cancelled since 1pm.\" I responded sorry I was at work I didn\\'t know. She tells me her plane is arriving which wasn\\'t at the gate refused to help and does a slight jog to the gate and tells me to go back through security to the ticket desk. Once I get to ticketing outside of security the agent simply keeps repeating that \"flight is cancelled due to weather\". She reluctantly says after me asking repeatedly what does that mean, that I have to get myself a hotel for the night. She doesn\\'t offer me any kind of information on how or who to call. She just ask if i was from there and I said no. After I ask another agent what does this mean she hands me a pink form with number and how to get a hotel. I then go back through security and once I look at the board I see a flight that will get me out of OKC with these very unhelpful United Employees. I call customer service and they rebook me on the IAH flight so I can get out of OKC and guess whose gate it is... The gate agent who says she was so busy even though the plane had not arrived and was being very dismissive The agent on the phone checked me in and I had them on speaker phone. I explained that to her and she goes policy is we can\\'t let you on the flight because it\\'s too close to departure. The same lady that told me I should have known in our previous encounter says says \"you should have called earlier.\" I emphatically explain how when I\\'m checked in already and I\\'m on the phone with a United Employee. He was on speakerphone \"are they not letting you board? You are checked in.\" She again says no and to talk to her supervisor and points. She says it\\'s policy but then reluctantly walks over and let\\'s me board as if she was doing me a favor. Apparently policy didn\\'t matter then and I wish the ordeal stopped there. When I get on the plane all of the bins are closed so I ask where can I put my bag. As far as I am concerned it could have been checked. The flight attendant gives me a bewildered how do I know look and ask what seat I\\'m in. It really didnt matter when I\\'m one of the last people on the plane and all bins are closed. I go to my seat and open multiple bins only for her to to walk back and open one bin that has room and wasn\\'t by my seat.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Ft Lauderdale. I booked a flight for myself and my wife 3 months out. I Upgraded to first class for an additional 400 dollars each ticket. I called back a week later to change my flight because our accommodations cancelled. They claimed that prices had changed and wanted to refund me $128.00 per ticket to go back to economy class instead of crediting me the S400 I paid per ticket. They also said that if i wanted to change the dates there would be a $200 dollar per ticket change fee plus an additional $200 dollars per ticket to get the same first class tickets one week later. This airline should be investigated for the outrageous practices they employ!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Arcata via San Francisco. Return trip miserable. Rerouted three times, all delayed. Luggage sent to wrong airport despite my checking on it three times with Baggage Claim and gate reps. 7 hours late. Never ever again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I was travelling with United to Denver International from London Heathrow. Cabin Crew were extremely unprofessional, they dropped a couple of items from my dinner tray as well as cutlery. Discourteous and non considerate at all. They didnâ€™t apologise and left me picking the items up. As well as this they locked the dimmable windows from when I boarded the plane and after multiple requests from myself and others they finally unlocked the windows so people could look out. It seemed as if they didnâ€™t know how to use the equipment and the Cabin Crews Customer Service was horrendous.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Kuna to Los Angeles. I have never experienced any worse airline customer service in my life. Nasty over the phone, nasty at the airport, nasty everywhere. One gets the feeling that they have special training for customers to be nasty to their customers. I honestly do not understand how they stay in business but most likely not enough competition yet!', 'united airlines Not Verified | San Antonio to Toronto via Chicago. All of our carry-on luggage was taken and put in checked baggage. An hour after the plane lands and the carousel is still not moving! Very frustrating. Will really think twice about using United. Flew down on Air Canada and it was 100x better experience.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London to Newark. Before our flight we read mostly bad reviews about United. We did not know what to expect but were much surprised when great staff, food, quality and service were offered to us. We rate it 9.5/10 because of a small delay on one of our 6 flights. Great experience, smooth without single problem, even the delay thing was solved easily and we caught our connecting flight.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Chicago via Springfield. Absolutely ridiculous. Flew out on Sunday from Springfield to Milwaukee with connecting flight in Chicago. Springfield was okay got right on and departed on time. Landed in Chicago, turned on my cell reception to immediately get a text stating my flight had been cancelled due to it needing repairs and to re book the next flight. No other flight we're available that day and I had to be where I was going by 8am the next day. So I was forced to take a bus to the Milwaukee airport. United could've provided a voucher or something instead of me having to come out of pocket to take that bus. Fast forward 6 days to the following Saturday. Trying to get back home leaving Milwaukee was no big deal. Landed I. Chicago and waited my 2 hour layover just to be announced over and over and over flight delayed due to plane needing repairs. This went on for about 4 hours. They wound up switching all of us to another plane. Finally get boarded and boom. Have to sit on the plane for almost an hour for them to repair a marker light on this plane. Not any compensation was offered for any inconveniences. Not even a complimentary adult beverage in flight. I'll never fly with United again. I'll stick to American. Their planes are newer and better maintained.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Honolulu. I made the mistake of booking United. This airline is great at treating you like a second class sub human - and that was only my check in! Not to mention the bait and switch on carryon fees. Itâ€™s now Spirit Airlines quality but without discount pricing and with extra abuse.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I booked this ticket exactly a week ago. The app told me it was a 92% that the plane is on time. So of course I get to Houston just to find out the plane is late due to maintenance. I purposely chose this flight because it landed at 3 and i worked at 5. But now my flight does not arrive in TPA until 4. So now I do not have a ride and the Uber home is 45$. I have already paid 354.82$ with no carry on just so I could get out of the airport quickly. The ladies at the desk in Houston were so rude asking me why I am questioning them and they do not provide ground transportation. I contacted customer service only for her to tell me file the claim and they will get back to me in 7 days. After this I went to the customer service desk located in section C in the Houston airport. The gentleman there was the kindest and reassured me I would get reimbursed for something because itâ€™s a plane issue which means itâ€™s United fault but I cannot handle the situation until I get to Tampa. So now my options are a 45$ Uber or I have no way of getting home. As I walk the hallways I see signs saying United #1 in on time departures and then I get to the website and see there are so many complaints about flight delays and not because of weather. Save your sanity do not fly United. Thanks for nothing United.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Duluth to Orlando via Chicago. I've just spent 145 minutes on the phone with United. I paid $30 to check my bag on the way down. United flight cancelled and paid another $30 to check it with Delta. Checked in for my flight home this morning and paid $30 to check my bag. Arrange new flight home, baggage fee does not transfer. So in essence, $120 to check one bag. Never again with United! Not sure what is so complex about transferring that payment over to a new flight. Agent kept telling me I'll be getting a refund, that doesn't help me now in getting my bag home.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Rapid City via Denver. We took only a carry on, no checked luggage to avoid unnecessary delays at the airport. Upon boarding the aircraft they took our carry-on as they said the overhead compartments were full. Once the aircraft was fully boarded, we were told there is a delay while they service the front strut on the plane. During the flight the WiFi didn't work. We arrived in Denver late and had to run through the airport to catch our next flight to Rapid City. We were to late to board, but they said it doesn't matter as the flight was going to be canceled for bad weather. When the flight was canceled we decided to drive to Rapid City, we requested our carry-on luggage which we should of had with us if but United took it from us. It took United Airlines 3 hours and 15 minutes to get the luggage from the canceled flight to the claim area. The staff was rude and uncaring, they said it can take up to 4 hours. Not 1 United employee apologized in any way for the canceled flight or the delay in retrieving our luggage. We paid $328.80 per ticket and United Airlines gave us a measly $101.94 back as a refund, for a flight they never provided. United Airlines service is terrible and they will rip you off! All appeals just fell on deaf ears.. F- The only thing they got right is we landed safely in Denver Colorado, half way to our destination.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to New York. The worst airline ever.

After 2 days i called for follow up and united refuse to reimburse me.', 'united airlines Not Verified | New Orleans to Chicago. My flight got cancelled due to weather which wasnâ€™t so bad. Definitely understandable. But where I am annoyed is that they automatically transferred the flight to a flight to Houston. I specifically asked the bag check to not put my bag on that flight seeing as though I decided to stay another night and try a flight the next day - but they went ahead and sent my luggage to Houston anyways. And said they couldnâ€™t send it back, that it would be sent to Chicago. So Iâ€™m stranded here with none of my things, Iâ€™m pregnant, and this is just flat out unacceptable. I will never fly United again. Also, tried calling someone to talk but was on hold for over 45 minutes so I have to resort to this. And lastly your planes are so uncomfortable, a measly 1hr and 45min plane ride was dreadful. My flight on the way to New Orleans was also delayed 3 hours! How can you operate and treat your customers like this?', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Early evening departure from Narita on Dreamliner (B787-800). Upgraded 2 days before to Economy plus seats. Boarding was efficient, and we departed on time. Economy plus seats gave additional legroom, and this was much appreciated. The 3-3-3 configuration is a little cramped width-wise, you just have to hope that your fellow passengers are on the petite size. Seats were equipped with headrests, but no foot-rests. Blankets and pillow provided, and earphones. IFE was pretty good - sharp, touch screen, reasonable selection of movies and TV shows and even an eclectic relaxation channel. Downside was audio - no selectable tracks, just a series of themed audio tracks which meant you just have to leave it on and wait for songs to appear. Food choices ranged from tolerable to OK, basically it's calories to sustain you. Crew ranged from relatively indifferent to briskly efficient. The Dreamliner made it a little more tolerable, with reduced noise levels even in economy. The biggest downside was that despite the adequate legroom, I found it really hard to get comfortable in the chairs - I can't explain it. Perhaps a combination of thin padding and/or compressed width? At the end, it was a flight to be endured rather than enjoyed, but perhaps that is a good outcome for a United flight.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My flight from Vegas was delayed due to the weather conditions in Denver according to the pilot. Okay I was fine with that because If the weather is bad for arriving planes then it would be bad for departing planes as well I thought logically. Was delayed an hour because I got to Denver at 9:44am instead of 8:52am but when I got here my connecting flight had left. Leaving me to wait in the airport until 5:20pm and getting home at 12am. I am very upset because I wanted to change my flight to leave on the 27th but couldnâ€™t and now Iâ€™m stuck not to mention the reason for the delay was incorrect so that United has no liability because it was not due to medical reason. You have my money and now satisfaction isnâ€™t important unless I pay more. Never will I chose United again better off flying with Spirit at least you can expect certain service for the price.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Buffalo via Chicago. First- I was charged $30 and forced to check a carry on. You can only bring a small bag that fits under your seat- backpack type size. People that were boarding with say a purse and a shoulder bag were spoken to rudely about it and forced to put purse inside bag in front of a camera? Ticket taker said to next guy who had one small bag â€œI see you read the memo.â€\\x9d And they laughed. So demeaning and unnecessary. This was boarding in San Francisco 35 minutes late btw. People were going to miss connecting flights - but the women with a purse that clearly would fit in her other bag were the important issue. I get to Chicago, find my gate- Grateful I only have 40 minutes to sit. About 15 minutes before scheduled boarding the attendant informs us there is a 2 hour delay due to the fact that the plane is not functioning or something like that. Not sure he could have shown less interest. I know - donâ€™t shoot the messenger- but this was 7:15 am, Iâ€™m sure everyone had been traveling as I had, and now needed to find some awful airport food to get through the new timeline. We all carefully choose flights to minimize this wasted time. I donâ€™t think people really care until they are affected. The flight from SFO was full. United will continue to do this.', \"united airlines Not Verified | I made a horrible rookie mistake. Thinking that a Boeing 787 would have the appropriate number if business class seats vs economy.

My $2000 refundable one way ticket with a Global upgrade and 100K status for 16 years with 2.7 million miles flown doesn't even get me close to the top of the upgrade list.

The first United Airlines flight from Richmond to Dulles was 2 hours late thus I missed my Paris flight. My wifeâ€™s flight was 1.5 hours late and she missed hers. The United gate agents in Richmond, with the exception of 1, were untrained, ineffective and mostly ignorant. My wifeâ€™s agent forgot to switch her luggage when she was rerouted through Germany.

We encountered weather problems or turbulence by Houston Airport or that was what I assumed. We circled the airport in the fog for 40 minutes with no communication from pilot or staff the entire time to let us know what was going on. Was an unnerving experience. On Jan 16 I again flew with United Airlines from Auckland to San Francisco. Again no communication from pilot or staff regarding the reason for the excessive turbulence. The stewardesses seemed to be very irritable and also the washrooms very dirty. The only thing said by the pilot was thanks for flying United after we landed. Will not recommend this airline for any future trips for anyone', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to Buffalo via Newark. I had a flight scheduled for 5:45pm on Jan. 21st, and 1 hour before the flight they decided to cancel it. I had work the next day. And of course, nothing was compensated. No hotel stay, no food, because it was weather related. I had to sleep in the terminal. I despise this sort of treatment. I will forever avoid United.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | We flew 1st class from ORD-PUJ in the Dominican Republic. I must say the flight back was good and that will be posted in a different review but this one was appalling. We were in the first row and had a birds eye view of the flight attendant having what I will call a bad hair day. She put her long, stringy hair in bun, let it down and put it up again and so on a few times. That wasn't so bad but at least twice she ran her fingers through her hair and dropped dislodged hairs and goodness only know what else directly onto the cabin floor! I can't believe it but she did. I never saw her wash her hands and yes she served meals too. The breakfast was supposed to be eggs Benedict. Well there was no poached egg, it resembled a scrambled mishmash and the Hollandaise sauce was baked into the egg instead of being a sauce. So in sum the food was poor and the sanitary practices simply failed due to negligence.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cincinnati to Chicago. Worst plane ride ever and that says a lot considering it was also the shortest. Extremely small and uncomfortable plane. After telling me my carry-on bag was fine, they decided it was too big, as well as many other people, and made us leave our bags outside the plane without telling us where to get them. After the ride was over I had to search for someone to ask, where they made us all line up in the cold and wait for them. They may have actually told us, but whoever gave the instructions spoke such a poor excuse for English it was pathetic, and I really don't mind accents normally, as long as I can understand. They can't do the job if nobody can understand them and they just keep yelling and gesturing and even grabbing at my belongings because they can't compose a sentence to tell me what to do with them. I was also supposed to be in a row by myself, but out of nowhere the flight crew pulls out a seat behind the wall and blocks me in the aisle and completely blocks off the bathroom so nobody could use it and making one long row with no space in it. I would never willingly book with this airline.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to San Francisco. Once again, a disappointing product from United on one of the longest trancontinental routes in the country. Old plane. Old seats. No seat back IFE. WiFi did not work. The food in First class was respectable though. United - please upgrade your fleet!', \"united airlines Not Verified | Denver to Chicago via Detroit. Was charged $30 per carry on bag, had to check our 2 bags, as they wouldn't allow us to carry on proper size bags cuz we booked economy. When we complained was told we should of done it at the airport which was crazy as they were backed up so bad and had no time. It's a trap! Just don't fly United, I know we won't ever again!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Madison to Newark via Chicago. This morning, I arrived at the airport and waited in line to check my bag for 25 minutes. Once I finally got up to the counter the agent at my desk disappeared for another 15 minutes. She finally came back but said I would miss my flight because I was a few minutes late from the checked baggage cutoff time. The agent tried rebooking my ticket for me. Iâ€™m not sure if she was new or wasnâ€™t trained on the system well enough because it took her a long time to rebook the ticket to the point where her supervisor had to jump in. Her supervisor told her to push me to the side and said that they would â€œdeal with me laterâ€\\x9d. I waited another 20 minutes for them to get through the rest of the line. Once I finally got my ticket rebooked, the flight is not only not a direct flight, itâ€™s also supposed to reach my destination 8 hours after my initial flight. First of all, I shouldnâ€™t have had been put on hold just because thereâ€™s a long line to get through. Secondly, right before I was pushed to the side, the agent promised to put me on the next possible flight at 11 am. But after being pushed aside, I got put on the 1:50 pm flight. The inconsistency and empty promising is so unacceptable. I am being lied to and neglected by your staff. I have never experienced this with other airlines. Delta next door had the same amount of people in line and they got through the line 30 minutes faster than United. Delta in the past had allowed me to board my airplane still while my baggage goes on the next flight but United would not allow me to do that. I have lost 8 hours of my time to spend with my parents whom I have not seen in 2 years due to the your staffâ€™s incapability to work efficiently. How could you possibly ever replace this valuable time I lost because of your inconsiderate employees. Thanks to United, I will now have 5 hours to cry at the airport. This experience is making me reconsider ever taking a United flight again. Especially seeing that comparison of service quality side by side with Delta.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Cincinnati. Maintains a very bad quality of service in all aspects. Customer service is not at all satisfying nor try to make any convincing to customers. Most delayed airline I have ever seen.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Memphis to Denver. The Memphis United gate agents and managers have awful attitudes and lack professionalism. The manager on duty was one of the rudest people I have ever met.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Lima to Houston. Cancelled a 1:30am flight because of a sick pilot. Do you have no back up pilots? Your people told us our next flight would be at the same time the next day. Then you change it to 11:00pm the day after next. Then, to top it all off, they send a bus to pick us up from the hotel at 7 and we arrive at the airport at 8 and none of the lines are open? Its about to be 2 hours before the flight leaves. I am never flying United again, so beyond frustrated.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flight there was ok. Flight back to Vegas became nightmare. From 12th of January when I suppose to go back home I came back today 2 pm and today is 14th. The worst experience what I had. First flight was delayed weather condition in Chicago where is my connection flight for Vegas - so obviously I will not make it. I cooperate and changing flight for 13th via Washington. I am came in the morning United app didnâ€™t notify me that flight is canceled!,I need to wait 8h for next one. Then that one I delayed. They change me then to American Airlines convincing me that I will make it like that. Then that flight was late 30 minutes and then I didnâ€™t make it again on my connection!!! So now itâ€™s already 9 pm, next flight is in the morning on 14th of January from Philadelphia and United phone agent is telling me that they donâ€™t know if they can provide me a hotel! Luckily nice woman name who is working there on United gates in Philadelphia helped me that I can have where to sleep that night. She is the only normal person with whom I spoke from United. I forgot to say when I wanted to complain and I did complain to manager of United in Harrisburg she answered me: well you chose by yourself to fly with United. That is not cool. Was so so frustrated and angry.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Houston to Colorado Springs. Flight was delayed due to an issue with the emergency brake. It took 30 minutes to figure this out before they made everyone get off the plane. Said it would be up to an hour delay. Eventually they switched planes. After 1.5 hours we boarded the new plane. We sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before taking off. Terrible experience with United Airlines. Would not recommend flying with them.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to Zurich, I wonder why their ratings are to the lowest. My experience with United truly upsetting and so much of a disappointment. Never received a compensation or refund after they left us in Rome Fiumicino Airport after flight was cancelled without a notification, they took our money and goodbye.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Honolulu to Los Angeles. United Airlines needs more check in assistance at HNL. I stood at a self check in screen for 30 minutes waiting for assistance. At this point I couldn't check my bags. The first assistant to help me forgot about me. Another 20 minutes pass and I have missed my flight and they had to book me on an American Airlines flight. In summary they cut costs on man power and it costs them man hours and customer satisfaction in the end.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Houston. This is absolutely the worst airline. I will never fly again with United. I booked four flights and needed to change one of the passengers names. My husband was originally going but because of work he could not so I wanted to change the passenger to my son. They would not under any circumstances allow me to do so. It is apparent this airline cares nothing about their customers!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I was flying from Lax to Athens via New York and London! From the beginning of our flight you can see how rude are the people that are working for United. Nobody helps us on the checking our bags. I was with my wife and our doughter 13 years old and when we ask that our seats on flight UA 934 were not on the same row they sad in a really very rude way - you have to ask at EWR airport. After arriving there we ask again and they try but the couldnâ€™t do anything! So, when we were on the plane, we ask our self other people if we can change seats. We notice that there were more people like us! Chaos! They took also all our small bags from LAX and they told us that you will get them in Athens! Finally we arrived with 3 from our bags broken! Dear United, you should learn service to your passengers from much smaller airline Aegean Airline or bigger one Lufthansa!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Bakersfield to Tampa. I have flown with many airlines in my life and this is by far the worst. They have continued their unbundling strategy for pricing. What this includes is removing carry-ons from the standard rate. This allows them to show a lower price 98% of people don't use because they're not going to walk-on role playing with just the shirt on their back. They have also used an algorithm to determine the most popular seats which aren't really any better than any other seats in economy but you have to pay extra for those. Top it off the service of the what is a Time counter recently especially terrible. Disinterested and rude, will not enjoy your flight.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This is the worst airline I have ever traveled with. I started using it about a year prior until i tried other airlines like Southwest, jetblue or Delta. Always delayed, rude staff and overpriced. You cannot cancel your ticket 24 hours after you book. You are overcharged for everything. I will never book it again. Bye bye United for ever.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to San Francisco. This airline charges $30 for bags checked, individually. I agree, but do not agree with charging for backpacks. The purpose of charging for bags was to get the TSA to screen faster, so sometimes people pack a lot of stuff and bring huge luggage that is ridiculous. Now if we want to check in a small backpack because we have 5 oz bottles of sauce from the country we visited, that does not make sense. At that point the airline is charging for profit and not thinking about its customer's needs nor about the origin of this screening rule, 9-11. The airline is taking profit from a tragedy we all endured and not thinking logically! For my family there is no more flying United. Our choices have power.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Madison to Chicago. I was flying home with a small bag and encounter fees that we were unaware of that cost 65 dollars. The lady was extremely rude and the above compartments were completely empty. This carrier has always been extremely difficult. Every other carrier American, Delta, Southwest are very accomodating and if you are looking to fly I would recommend using one of them. United will charge extra for everything you do with them.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. We encountered baggage fees we were unaware of. When we checked in they made us check all baggage. I think we were the only ones on the plane not allowed carry-ons. The bins above our seat were completely empty and the flight was not even full. Very disappointed checking baggage cost me an extra $70.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Houston. I booked a United flight for 12 January one way for $247 dollars three days ago. Upon checking my bank account it has occurred to me that United is holding $347 which is a $100 more than what I paid. When I called customer service to get the matter resolved they were no help. I talked to both a regular employee and the manager. Both admitted to a system error charging my account to much money and lied about when the funds would be back available in my account. It has now been well over 48 hours since I booked the flight and this airline is still holding this extra money.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Los Angeles. After this experience with United, they will not be my first choice any more. The flight had mechanical issues (which are understandable) but the service (by that I mean, attitude rudeness, and lack of information, or help) that we received from the employees at the gate was absolutely inconceivable and unnecessary. They were rude, absolutely unhelpful. And did nothing to help us during the 6+ hour delay. When I complained to United Customer service via their website after the flight, they were equally unapologetic and unhelpful. This has really soured my opinion of this airline and I will go out of my way in the future to avoid flying with them.', 'united airlines Not Verified | New Orleans to Houston via Seattle. On the first leg of my trip they somehow screwed up on seating assignments - the result was 30 minutes of musical chairs before take off. Beverage service took forever. They require payment for in flight entertainment ($8 to watch Direct TV?! Ridiculous) and don\\'t have charging ability for devices beyond row 21. The \"remote \" for the tv is located on the armrest, which means keeping one\\'s arms tucked uncomfortably within the seat so as to not change the channel on your neighbor\\'s screen. Wherever possible I will avoid United like the plague.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Las Vegas. United Airlines isnâ€™t my go to airline but sometimes I have to take it due to lack of alternatives. Whenever I do take it, I get reminded why I dislike taking it. In flight customer service has never impressed me. Flight attendants are unfriendly and unwilling to help. I got stuck with my small luggage because of lack of space in the business class. The flight attendant directed me to go to the back of the flight to find a spot when I was sitting upfront. This not only resulted a long delay for everyone but took me 15 minutes to get back to the front and just to find out I couldâ€™ve fit my bag in the overhead near my seat. Zero initiative to provide any help. Let me add laziness too to my description.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Greensboro. Not the first time I have had issues with my flights, always end up needing to wait extra time! Next time I need to choose a company to fly with, United Airlines definitely wonâ€™t be my first option!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Shanghai to Newark. I ordered the ticket a month in advance and had to transfer from Shanghai Hongqiao airport to Shanghai Pudong airport. When I arrived to check in the staff told me all seats were sold out. It was outrageous they didn't give me a refund prior to flying out they instead promised me a seat that wasn't empty I was furious. The airline messed up on my order and still had the nerve to upgrade someone's seat instead save your money and book elsewhere United Airlines treat their customers like a joke. The staff on board were attentive but the leg room seemed to be smaller than other aircraft. In addition, the food was dry and mediocre it was hard to swallow. I will no longer book through United Airlines after this ridiculous first experience with them.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to San Francisco. Over the top service in business class right from check in to the Polaris lounge ( centurion eat your heart out) To the staff being so attentive and trying to get everyone taken care of. 2 hr rain delay at sfo... they apologized for rain. And then they announced that a few people were trying to make an international connections if everyone could stay in their seats so these people could get off first... and everyone listened. Well 1 very anxious couple defied the stewardess orders and walked to the exit area and sat right in front of it while we were still taxiing on the runway, the stewardesses were firm and did not escalate the situation.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Las Vegas to Halifax via Newark. These people are the most rude and selfish people I have ever dealt with. I am in the Canadian military and specifically asked before booking my flight whether we were covered for checked baggage. I was told that I am and so I booked with them. Now being at the airport they tell me they only cover for US and refuse to do anything to help me out. They were condescending, rude, and refused to help out with anything wanting me to pay over $300USD for my 3 bags. Eventually rebooked to Air Canada and I would recommend Air Canada to anyone.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Syracuse to Las Vegas via Chicago. United recently impressed me when I was promised a travel voucher and to be able to change flights by reservation agent. I confirmed the details multiple times. I asked if I would have to go to the gate and through security and he said no. The agent also said the voucher and changing flight was guaranteed and it was rare to be offered this. I showed up to the airport today with no bags (because I was guaranteed a voucher and to switch flights). Then I realized I was lied to. Lady at the ticketing counter in Syracuse was very helpful, but said that I was misinformed. I ended up spending over 2 hours between the ticketing counter and calling reservations today. I received a later flight but no voucher. I feel deceived and absolutely disrespected. Thereâ€™s such a lack in their customer service experience and overall respect for peopleâ€™s time, which is now something I canâ€™t get back. I have now wasted non refundable minutes dealing with something I was promised multiple times. I will not be using United as my airline of choice and highly advise against using them.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Los Angeles. One of the worst airlines I've ever flown on. Will never fly with them again. If anything goes wrong, be warned that they will not work with you to compensate. The service is horrible, their policies are worse. Very greedy airline, would never recommend.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I had the worst flight of my life with United Airline! They retarded our flight from Houston to San Jose Costa Rica and they were trying to let us think it was because of the weather, but all other airline managed to make their flight that day. They canceled our flight because they were missing staff, but still they were saying it was weather. The flight was schedule for 9:15am on the next morning, but they still didn't had staff. They finally made the flight passes 11:00am. That flight was schedule originally the day before at 9:30pm. Furthermore, after cancelling my flight back before the 24hours allowed to cancel it they confirm that my flight was canceled, but did not refund it. I'm still trying to get the refund... Worst airline: United Airline\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | We flew from Houston to Bogota in a night flight, so the first thing you would expect of a night flight is to have a comfortable pillow and a thick, nice blanket. That's the first mistake, no pillow and some cheap blanket that made no difference to the super cold AC. Well, we won't sleep, let's watch a movie or something with this nice DirecTV screen in front of us. Surprise! The screen won't let you open even the flight map without swiping your card for 8 dollars. I guess I will have to use the United App and watch something there, but I'm running out of battery. Surprise, only Business and Economy Plus rows have power outlets. United Airlines' staff are nice and caring but anyway those mistakes make me have a bitter experience with them. Not recommended.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Wilkes Berre to Albuquerque via Chicago. I have never been so heartbroken in my life. I booked my flight months prior looking forward to a wonderful vacation reuniting with my family, then a couple weeks before my flight I get a call my grandmother is in the hospital and not doing well she has about 3 months to live, I figured okay I can still be there in a couple weeks to see her. Flash forward to a week before my flight, I get another call my grandmother is fading fast and is in comfort care (meaning end of life) and she wont last more than a few days. I call the airline asking if there is any possible way I can get a sooner flight. And although the gentleman who was helping me through customer service was very kind and very sympathetic to my situation, trying everything he can do to help me, the manager denied me. I cannot believe how selfish this company is. They do not care about their customers they ONLY care about their money.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Norfolk to Houston. Booked through Orbitz. Paid $22 dollars per ticket for insurance. Don't do it! Even with the insurance United would not work with the agent to refund the ticket. Had to change due to Active Duty orders and still they would not work with me. I contacted Orbitz and got refunded my insurance on the tickets ($66) and they told me to call United directly to try and get a refund with orders. After being on hold for 25 minutes with United the rep told me she could not transfer me to the department refund and that I would need to talk to Orbitz again so that they could contact them. Requested to speak with supervisor and she had me submit a form online for my refund. Terrible customer service and the worst part is that I only needed to change my flights to an earlier time and cancel my return flight (not my families ticket) and they still would not work with me. Never will work with United again. I'm a rewards member with Delta and American and come to find out the extra $50 or $100 you are gonna pay is 100% worth it. If you are still reading stay far away!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Madison to St. Louis via Chicago. I arrived in Chicago to transfer planes in order to make it to St. Louis. The flight has a creeping delay, currently at an hour and a half delay. No notice was sent out to notify of the delay. No explanation is given for the delay. This is already an evening flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cancun to San Francisco. United Airlines desperately need to upgrade these planes. We paid over $2000 USD for each seat on this flight, and the first class seats donâ€™t even have tvs or usb ports. The seats are basically just wider seats than the normal seats. I have flown on Delta and American recently and both of those airlines are more updated with nice tvs, usbs, seats that fully lay flat and are way more comfortable. The flight attendants are nice, but I definitely do not recommend United Airlines.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Port of Spain. If oneâ€™s wondering if customer service has died among the US carriers then any flight with United will confirm that sadly it is deep in the grave. If the insults of charging customers for every single small comfort ever conceived in private transport, werenâ€™t already enough, the totally apathetic or even hostile attitude of the staff in anything but top tier business class, appears to demand that already deceased customers, rise just to be killed again. Passengers flying United are treated no better than cattle, or more properly cash cows to be milked, and then thrown off the plane. In both of our flights the only time the cabin crew even spoke to customers was to reprimand them or tontry and talk them into checking a bag. Heaven forbid they expend a calorie trying to welcome or make customers fee at home. The boarding process for our intâ€™l flight was a keystone cops disaster which could have easily been avoided with simple crowd management measures. Instead they stuffed an entire four groups into two narrow lines - even though they had four and expected people to trample over each other. The solo cranky ticket taker was snapping at customers telling them to â€œgo here, â€œ then no, there!â€\\x9d while a security person randomly deleted bags - by eye to get tagged and taken from customers as they entered the plane - no advisory, explanation, apology, nothing. Not a manager was to be seen during all this and our departure was over an hour late. Horrible experience from start to finish. That will be our very last flight on United ever.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Their online booking is misleading (out and out tells you one thing but you end up with another). The staff is rude and â€œjust do not careâ€\\x9d. Whatever happened to the days when people were just nice to each other just because one can be? What happened to businesses that cared about their clients? Well some still exist - but it isnâ€™t United airlines. They have extremely rude staff every single time Iâ€™ve flown with them. Lost my luggage out of Cancun but didnâ€™t help me in the least to hook in with the insurance I bought. So stressful I just ate it and went on with life. This is literally the worst company on the planet to date for me to review. Zero business ethics. Zero customer care ethics. Investing in anything to do with United is out of the question. Flying with them - not if my life depended on it.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Atlanta to Eagle. United is terrible. We had a 24 hour layover due to weather and not even a free hotel to stay in because apparently â€œthey donâ€™t cover that.â€\\x9d Iâ€™m sitting at our gate right now in which I was supposed to leave yesterday. Thereâ€™s not one staff member and the plane was supposed to leave at 7:15 but could not because the captain was a no show. Please help yourself arrive to your destination easier and travel delta. Iâ€™ve never been treated like this on a delta flight.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sydney to Newark via San Francisco. One of the worst Airlines i have ever travelled with.

They even missed to load our baggage and couldn't deliver it back on time. All in all i am never travelling with them again.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Los Angeles to Grand Cayman via Houston. The United employees this morning were so rude, I was honestly taken aback. I had a question about where to go as I had a problem entering my passport information online. The employee I asked just repeatedly told me it was not her section so she couldnâ€™t help me. When I did figure out where to go, I entered my info into the kiosk but needed an employee to verify it. She patronized me and treated me like a moron for not being able to scan my passport. I never fly United and will try not to again. This experience made me realize how politely Iâ€™ve always been treated by Southwest, and now I wonâ€™t take that for granted. United employees must be pretty unhappy. Their customer service is non-existent.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Fort Wayne. Snow is falling in Chicago. The lady next to me misses her flight. The gentleman working C8 gates at 21:26 in O'Hare shrugs his shoulders and says go to customer service. No emotion, no apology. Was more interested in flirting with another passenger. I also bought a direct flight in March of 2018 for a direct flight to NYC from Fort Wayne. I never received my vouchers and trying to call to inquire about them is more difficult then walking through the Grand Canyon. Might be the cheapest airlines but step it up United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to McAllen via Houston. Absolute nightmare! Worst experience Iâ€™ve had!

This was the worst flight in my entire life and I am 62 years old. I will NEVER fly United Airlines again. We started boarding on time and were about 1/2 full when they asked us to deplane for a maintenance issue. At first, we weren't told when they thought we might take iff. Then every 1/2 hr they would say it would be another 1/2 hr before we knew anything. I learned more about the problem in United's texts than from their Customer Service personnel. We finally were told it was ONE indicator light that wasn't working. After 2 1/2 hours they told people about another possible flight leaving at 7 pm. The problem with that was it was completely FULL & had people on standby. So you could give up a PAID RESERVATION for a seat on another flight with the slight possibility of getting on. This made no sense. They finally brought out free water and snacks but never bothered announcing this so by the time I'd heard about it they were all gone. They then changed our gate to a less comfortable location with fewer seats. People were seating on the floor. I've got health issues and this entire experience was awful . I usually fly with Southwest and I've never encountered anything like this. I understand that it is the holidays but United should have been better prepared for situations such as this. Think twice before flying United.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Cancun to London via Houston. Never again! Placed me in a complete opposite of the plane from my wife even though I selected my seats! United staff when we arrived at Houston said no matter where we were going with our connecting flight I would have to collect our luggage - waited 20 minutes for luggage only to be informed we did not have to collect it! Nearly missed our connecting flight due the stupidness of staff.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Saint Louis. I have never had a 50 pound bag completely lost. Somehow, United did it. The gentleman that helped me in STL was super helpful, but even he said that United workers in Houston were screwing up really bad. I do not think they care about their customers in Houston which is sad. I am disappointed.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Houston. Miserable inconsiderate employees.

Donâ€™t do it.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Puerto Vallarta. Never again, and Iâ€™m not a picky traveller. Redirected due to weather/not enough gas. Airplane late, missed my flight to Guadalajara. United could not book me on the next two flights to where they were supposed to, so booked me to a different city the next day. Iâ€™m fine paying a bit to stay overnight, but now Iâ€™ll be in a different city and have to figure out a way to get to my final destination. Double accommodation and double the bus booked now and paid, and UA doesnâ€™t even want to help by offering to pay anything, yet alone a taxi. UA we understand weather canâ€™t be controlled, but if you canâ€™t get me to my destination, shouldnâ€™t that be compensated? I got a meal voucher though (laughs out loud, 24h limit). Itâ€™s 11pm and Iâ€™m tired, exhausted and fed up spending extra money, Iâ€™m not hungry and a meal voucher doesnâ€™t cut it.

I called the number provided and was informed that because I missed the train connecting me to Philly after my first flight (which I missed because of to the delayed flight) my return ticket was voided and I was no longer on the flight! I received no notification of this, not a text, email. And was not reimbursed at all. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with their Customer Service who then informed I would need to pay an additional $411 to have my ticket reinstated.(I had already paid 600 for this round trip) Iâ€™d rather hitch hike 1600 miles with strangers than fly United again. Happy holidays to me, right? I ended up having to spend another $525 I didn't have to get flight back with a different airline. I fly a decent amount having family and work locations all over the country, I strayed away from usual airline to save $100 bucks on this trip and it ended up costing me an extra $550 after all things in included. Worst travel experience of my life, even Spirit wasnâ€™t this bad.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | LaGuardia to Washington via Orlando. Worst flying experience ever.

Staff was every rude, my first time flying with this airline, and never again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Tel Aviv. The worst experience of my lifetime! I was supposed to fly on 12/25/18 for a very short trip for a family reunion and my daughter's celebrations. My flight was cancelled when I arrived to airport (less than 3 hours before the flight) and the cancellation text message came from Expedia, not United! United did not even bother to let me know in advance so that I would not go to the airport for nothing! I hold the driver who brought us to the airport for a while to figure out what happened. At the entrance I was told by a United rep that the flight is still on, just the aircraft was replaced so I have to check-in again (I did online check-in the day before). So I let the driver go and was waiting in the line until I reached the check-in desk where I was told that the flight is cancelled and there are no seats on the replacement flight. Nobody apologized. None of the agents looked a tiny bit sorry about what happened and nobody rushed to help resolve the situation. It felt like a 3rd hand company in a developing country, not the biggest American airline. After lots of efforts I got a replacement flight a day after and with a several hours stop in Europe. I was not offered any compensation for the damage they caused to us as all our Israeli plans had to change. After spending quite a bit of time trying to find a way to submit a complaint I finally did it and received an automated message offering $200 e-ticket or bonus miles. I do not need any of them as I will do my best to never fly United again! What a horrible Christmas experience.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Los Angeles. Terrible experience, delayed over 5 hours! Not updating us what is happening! United service people were terrible and very rude. I will never fly with them again. Did not give food vouchers for evening flight. Just canâ€™t believe this.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Mumbai. United airlines had the worst customer service on the ground. I flew on Christmas. But even accounting for the holiday rush, their services were just unbelievably bad! To begin with, they had a common check-in for ALL flights. To add to the chaos, everybody was supposed to check-in at the kiosk and there was absolutely nobody to help in case somebody got stuck. At one point 5 out of 6 kiosks were unable to complete the check-in, stranding people behind. There was a separate queue for travel assistance, which had about 20-30 people waiting and only 1 counter was available for assistance. It took us about 1 hour 45 min to complete the check in and reach the security. On another note, I was traveling with my boyfriend and we wanted our seats together. We had selected the seats immediately after booking our tickets. The seats got reshuffled three times due to \"a change in the plane\" and \"the system\" reshuffled the seats such that our seats got separated. United surely needs to fix their \"system\" that is unable to do a simple one-to-one mapping and is somehow adding a random factor on its own. I hope United fixes these issues soon.', 'united airlines Not Verified | We paid $350 for my 12 year old to fly from Houston to Amsterdam with their unaccompanied minor program. The united attendant did not pay attention while they were in the baggAGe area and my son picked up an identical suitcase. I spent hours on our vacation trying to get the suitcase back to the true owners. They even had all their Christmas presents in there. Could never find anyone at United to escalate to. Had to buy overpriced clothes for my son. United is worthless. If they werenâ€™t watching the baggage pick up - what else were they not watching.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Los Angeles to Kona. First since we booked through Air Canada and rerouted to United they refused us access in the lounge at the airport. There were six other first class guests who had the same issue as us on the flight. The 737 was old and did not have TVs, it was suggested we could download the United app since it would allow us access to Internet. Problem was it would not be accessible for about two hours of the trip. We were told United was removing all unnecessary weight from planes to allow for more seating and storage. Since just about everyone now days travels with a mobile device it was not something they felt clients needed. First of all we do not pay all that extra to fly in a stripped Dow situation. It is bad enough they have reduced the number of washrooms and the one at the front is in constant us from people in economy. The aisles are filled with people and the staff precariously avoiding them will trying to serve. What is the benefit now, wider seats, a $12.00 meal and a few glasses of inexpensive wine. Even your luggage which has a priority comes out at with everyone else's. Get your act together or change the statis to Elite Economy.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Honolulu to San Francisco. There were two staff members. First one was most rude and you could feel the anxiety in the air, she made us wait with my niecesâ€™ belongings to â€œorganizeâ€\\x9d it so it that we could carry it down the loading aisle, she continued to bombard my sister about the ticket for my niece when she is a lap child, stupidity. When we boarded the plane a stewardess had no idea what she was doing. I was flying with my sister and her 20 month old child and there was tons of seats available and our tickets had us separated but apparently it is too much of an inconvenience to let me sit with them from row 43 to row 37 - initially she said it was fine and then changed her mind and made me move all my belongings and sit in my initial seat and now my sister is alone without aid, (despite her being a strong mom that I know could handle the situation but anybody with children will always appreciate the extra hand). Anyways she was indifferent and unaccomodating to the situation and used whatever power she thought she had to control the situation. Unfortunately, these two employees made your business look bad today and your company has to suffer due to their inadequacies and pure ridiculousness.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Tokyo to Denver. Iâ€™ve flown both trans-Atlantic and trans-pacific flights so long haul is nothing new to me. On this flight, Iâ€™d like to address the food service that United has. Airline food is a means to an end. Youâ€™re trapped in a metal tube and you eventually get hungry, so the food service is there to help pass the time. I have to say that this is one of the worst meals Iâ€™ve had while flying. The chicken was horribly dry and had some sort of paste covering it that made it inedible. The rice was also dry and crunchy. My seat mates made the same comment and eventually just covered the food back up. On other long haul flights Iâ€™ve had some sort of snack service about half way between the 2 meals but not on United. If youâ€™re on one of Unitedâ€™s long haul flights, be sure to bring snacks on board!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | New Orleans to Washington. Every flight I have flown with United in the past year has been delayed. They are terrible in informing passengers and are always vague with their information. Consistently the worst airline experience.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Will never fly with United again, and would give 0/10 if I could. We were all boarded onto the flight, made to wait, only to deplane and be given 30 minute delay after 30 minute delay. After 2.5 hours of this, the plane was ultimately delayed by 9 hours. The flight attendant was unfriendly to the irritated passengers and did little to help reschedule flights. Also no food vouchers were given. Worst experience with an airline I've ever had.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Gillette to Denver via Charlotte. Unbelievable, my wife and I bought our tickets 6 months ago and we were obviously placed in middle seats on different sides of the plane on purpose. We got to the gate early and we were informed we were not allowed to sit together with our fare, our 500 dollar fare. This used to never be an issue to move seats so family can sit together. This airline is budget trash now and we will never fly United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Newark return, and both flights were delayed. My experience with United Airlines was horrible. The first one was delayed about 2,5h because the pilot couldn't reach the airport (problems could happen, I understand) and then because the aircraft needed maintenance. But the worst thing happened from Newark to London where the flight was delayed about 5h because, again, aircraft maintenance. After an overall 8h delays in two flights, their horrible customer care could only offer me a useless e voucher(expires in one year, I am not from USA and might not come back within one year) that doesn't really match the real cost. I can understand they can have problems, but they have to change compensation policies. You cannot offer me an evoucher in order to oblige me to fly with you again. Not recommended at all, I'll try to stay away from this company.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Newark. Same problem with the menu as with our flight from Sydney to Houston. Ran out of a dish by the time the staff got to me - there were only 16 people in business, 6 of those children so I had to have one of the snack boxes from economy. I donâ€™t understand. You know how many people are booked so how hard is it to have both options available? Staff very helpful and polite. Not his fault I know. Tired little plane again with tired and very well used amenities. No internal entertainment on this flight either. Bad luck if you did not have a tablet or phone to use the United App. You need to up your game United and quick.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | While flying from Reno to Los Angeles they ask us to put our carry-ons down the airplane. We did. As soon as we looked for them, after the flight, my husbandâ€™s carry-on was all mashed and rotten. I told the person in charge that â€œplease next time be careful because look what happenedâ€\\x9d, he looked, didnâ€™t say anything and totally ignored us. Very disappointed with his attitude and not even an apologize. Very sad experience, we will never trust United Airlines with our baggage.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Antonio to Appleton. A terrible experience overall. The airline will get you from point A to point B but it will be very uncomfortable. The aircraft in the fleet are tiny. Most adults do not fit comfortably in the seats and many could not stand up inside the aircraft without hitting their heads on the low ceiling. There is also very little storage space on the plane. I am considering buying a one way ticket with another airline for the trip home because United aircraft are so uncomfortable. They claim the small aircraft are more economical because of cheaper fuel costs due to reduced weight and better aerodynamics, but other airlines use larger aircraft and provide far better service for only a few dollars more.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sydney to New York via Houston. What a tired airplane with tired facilities and tired staff. The seats were so close to the isle I had to make sure my arm was inside the seat. Food when it came was great but when asked what my selection was from the menu I was told that I would be put on a waiting list to see if my choices were available I assume after feeding first class first which I have never heard of before. I asked for a bottle of water and was told due to cut backs it was one bottle per person per trip but they could refill it. Breakfast, I was told off by the stewardess who was super stressed during the flight, because I did not eat my corn flakes which she had to tell another passenger she could not have so I could eat them! My god, I paid over $7000 for a seat on this airplane to be told off because I did not eat my corn flakes! The bathrooms were so small I did not even bother to change my clothes not only because I could not move but there was either water or urine on the floor. Maybe I am spoiled as I have flown business with Qatar Airways and Emerites and they are spacious planes with stewards that are not stressed with big bathrooms that are cleaned regularly and a menu that when you ask for something thatâ€™s is on the menu you are not told you will be waitlisted. Selection of movies very old. No new releases. No offer of any magazines or papers nothing. So I sit here at Houston waiting to board for the next leg of my journey hoping and praying itâ€™s better than the one from Sydney or I wonâ€™t be flying with United long haul again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Houston. Absolutely horrible. Time management is little to none. No staff updated on delay after delay after delay. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6:25 and after one hour sitting on the plane we werenâ€™t told a single thing about the status of the flight. Very unprofessional staff and crew. Horrible, horrible experience.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | We booked a flight from Pittsburgh to San Diego via San Francisco. The flight got delayed by 3hrs (they delayed for an hour at first, then for 2 hours and the final announcement said 3hr delay) and we missed the connecting flight. The crew are so rude that they didnâ€™t even apologize. They said all they can do is book another flight the next morning for free of cost. Seriously? You ruined my trip and thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it. They are not even paying for my accommodation for overnight stay in SF. Iâ€™m never ever gonna fly through United again after this trip.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Newark. Literally the worst airline experience ever. Iâ€™ve flown so many times in my life. United Airlines has the most unprofessional, rude, and unorganized staff and service around. I will definitely stick with Allegient from now on.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to San Diego via San Francisco which is having a layover of about 1hr 30mins. Just after 10mins of the boarding start time they announced that the flight is delayed for about an hour and later on they delayed it by another 1hr and then finally 1hr 30mins. They kept on changing the time. We knew definitely we would miss the flight, so we asked for other options that we would get as our flight is at 9:09. There is only one flight in the next day morning from SFO to SAN and we were on standby. We asked for compensation or even just providing us the accomodation but they said that they canâ€™t as it is not the issue with maintainance and it is an air traffic issue. Finally they confirmed another flight from SFO to SAN which is at 12:52. This is too bad for an airlines, there were like almost 10-12 people who want to reach SAN and to do that everyone has to reach SFO by midnight and catch another flight at 12:52 in the next day. Itâ€™s like missing the whole day, and they canâ€™t do anything for that. United are so irresponsible and they were just smiling without even saying sorry. They kept saying just wait here, donâ€™t go anywhere may be the time would change but it kept on increasing hour by hour. I donâ€™t even know how can they state themselves as No.1 in customer satisfaction which is completely false. The same kind of delay happened with few other airlines, but they are good at least they felt sorry and even compensated us.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Reno. This is the worst airline I have ever been on. I have given this airline 5 chances and every time something goes wrong. I would understand if an airline had delays some time but every time is inexcusable, I feel like it was false advertising the times it says because that is most certainly not the real time. I have never given a review in my life but I am so mad I need people to know so they donâ€™t have to go through the same thing the experience I have had with this airline is terrible, and I will not be flying with them again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. Slow boarding process on a full flight, very friendly and attentive cabin staff, the plane was very fresh and though the flight was short but a long taxing on take off and landing caused a slight delay.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Burlington to Newark. The United flight was delayed 3 hours, and when we landed I received a message that my luggage did not arrive, it will arrive on the following flight. The customer service is terrible, lacking compassion and totally inefficient. My luggage did not arrive within 24 hours, as promised. 2 days later and I still havenâ€™t received my suitcase. They have lied on the phone and miscommunicated between me and the driver service. What a disappointing and ugly experience. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Oaxaca via Houston. Holding customers for ransom? I recently had an unbelievable experience flying to Mexico on United with a bike. Booked the flight several months back, checked with the United call centre on charges for taking a bike and confirmed what I'd read earlier on the United web site. Both made it clear that if the bike bag fell within weight and dimensional limits it would be charged simply as a second item of checked baggage i.e. $50. When I checked in at the airport, the United agent insisted that I owed an extra $200 (!) for the bike even though it came in under 50 lb limit and was the standard dimensions set out in the Airline's limits. No amount of back and forth would bring them round to honour the original terms. And curiously my two companions who had checked in a little earlier for the same flights also with bikes were charged much less - one paid $25 as it was his first and only item of checked luggage and the other was charged nothing for his bike as second item (his was in an identical Evoc bike bag and weighed just a little more than mine). The experience left a very bad taste. What can you do but pay up when you have already bought the ticket and will be leaving soon? This seems to be the kind of business practice you would expect of a dubious, disreputable business or one might experience in some part of the world where corrupt practices are more common.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | On an 8 hour trip from Honolulu to Houston the flight attendants sprayed the cabin of the plane with a bad smelling air freshener with no regards to anyoneâ€™s health, including babies and younger children. Many people on the plane were coughing. Iâ€™ve never experienced this on an airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United Airlines from Indianapolis to Denver. Took well over an hour from the original departure time to even begin boarding which caused many personal schedule errors to ensue after. I understand delays occur, however I have never experienced delays this long with any other company.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I have yet to be treated this horribly! I have flown for work for the past 10 years on different airlines including United and this has been the worst experience. Since when are passengers treated with such distrust and since when is it ok for United employees to be this rude to passengers? Initially I was questioned about the size of my carry-on which I travel with all the time. She right away said to check it and I tried to put it in the size checker and I explained that I had placed my laptop in the outside pocket which is why it looks â€œthickerâ€\\x9d so let me just put it inside the bag and itâ€™ll be fine and she just said â€œif you check it you canâ€™t check the laptopâ€\\x9d and I replied â€œno, the point is Iâ€™m not checking it bc it fitsâ€\\x9d and she said â€œitâ€™s doesnt fit so check it - I made an announcement earlier so you should knowâ€\\x9d. Firstly, the bag fit, and so she just walked away without saying anything and then secondly since when is it ok to â€œscoldâ€\\x9d me like I â€œshould knowâ€\\x9d? Really? Then I cut my finger on the size checker and I asked a flight attendant for a bandaid and she said she canâ€™t get one. I said Iâ€™m bleeding. She said she canâ€™t leave the front and the first aid is in the middle. I said isnâ€™t there a flight attendant in the middle and she said â€œyes but they are assisting someone elseâ€\\x9d. What kind of operation is this? Then later after 10 minutes she comes by and gives me a bandaid without a word. What kind of customer service is this?', 'united airlines Not Verified | Never warned about flight cancellations and was told it was confirmed the night before with no help from the desk. Was told there was a walmart and that was supposed to make up for it. Waste of time. Incompetence to the highest degree and a lack of care. Even told them I had orders to be reporting into for the military and all I got was an \\'oh well\\' from the desk staff. Then when I tried to transfer flights they wouldn\\'t because \"they would lose money\". United Airlines is a terrible airline, doesn\\'t care about you or your money, and would rather you just stay put instead of getting you anywhere.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Minneapolis. There was no prior warning of our flight being delayed until five minutes prior to the plane boarding. Every 30 minutes they delayed our flight another 1/2 hour for a total of five hours. Then at 12:00am they announced our flight would be cancelled. They sent all 200 passengers to customer service where three employees worked to put customers in hotels. After 1.5 hour wait in line we were informed there were not hotel rooms left for the night and we were forced to sleep at the airport. There has been no compensation for our trouble and our seats for the flight we were booked on in the morning were all the way to the back. They upgraded the business class passengers to first class conveying they do not value the every day vacationer but cooperate business who frequently use their airline. I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This morning I encountered probably the worst customer service of my life. The person at the check-in desk was incompetent and rude. I had a valid document for travel to Mexico with an official green card stamp in my passport and she got confused and told me she has never seen this and decided to leave with my passport and go somewhere without even explaining her actions. When I confronted her and asked not to leave with my documents she said: \"I won\\'t be able to help you, I just can\\'t deal with the attitude right now\". When I finally made her talk to the supervisor and he looked at my documents and said \"oh yeah that\\'s ok\". I wasted 40 minutes of my life.

Me and my wife travel alot but next time we will pay extra $$$ to travel but will not be travelling from United Airlines. Not recommended at all.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Dallas Ft Worth to Houston. When we arrived at the airport (after our driver being pulled over which took time) we still had one hour before departure. As I have never flown on United before, I didnâ€™t know the procedure. We went straight to the baggage drop and told them weâ€™re getting late, instead of informing us to go to a different kiosk to check in our bags, they referred us to the monitor. And while we were trying to check in the monitor said to see an agent, (which was ONE agent in the corner which was somewhat helpful) but his supervisor was so rude and mean and didnâ€™t let us even talk. I didnâ€™t expect someone at a supervisor or management position to act this way. Do United not give supervisor training to their managers? I was very disappointed and our whole vacation mode was ruined. Now Iâ€™m waiting at the airport and will have to wait for another 4 hours.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orange County to Knoxville via Chicago. I wish I could give zero star to this airline. I promised myself two years ago not to travel with United ever again, but my trip was booked by my agency and it was too late to change it.

For sure, this will be my last time I ever travel with United.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Charleston to Newark. My flight was delayed and then cancelled. My experience with staff at the boarding counter was not good. She was rude and not sympathetic to the situation. Another staff at the boarding counter was understanding and helpful. There was a flight available for an earlier time than what they rescheduled me for, but the first staff did not inform me at the ticket counter. I was later told over the phone when I called United. I was told there would be a $200 up charge for that flight because it was in a different class than I had originally booked. I do not feel a customer should be charged when their flight was cancelled and there are available seats on the next flight. I ended up having to switch airlines and airports which is now causing even more delays. I also purchased a non-stop flight and am now going to have a layover.

Gate agents would not place call to attempt to hold flight. Placed in a hotel 30 minutes away and told it was the most convenient. Told my food vouchers would work at the hotel. Hotel had no restaurant and vouchers did not work. Awful experience. Will do everything in my power to never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Cedar Rapids. Hands down the worst airport experience Iâ€™ve even had they switched gates without informing anyone so I ran to the new gate after I was planning to board. No employees were present at the desk. Banged on the door while the plane was still attached 5 minutes later the plane detaches an employee comes out and tells me they canâ€™t re connect even tho the plane hasnâ€™t event began to think of moving. They switch me to the next flight 3 hours later. Flight gets switched gates 3 times and delayed. Iâ€™ve been in Chicago airport from 9 am - 4pm all to wait for a one hour flight. On my trip home through O Hare my flight arrived but it there were no gates available for over half an hour causing the whole plane to miss there connecting flights. When I got off I asked if they could page the airline to hold it and the lady told me to run because I have 10 mins.

What does it take and how long does it take for a website to take a credit card other than an American one and why isn't this a priority getting it fixed or why can they not take a credit card over the phone to book the seat?

She and her coworkers at Lincoln Airport were my saviors. Under a lot of pressure these women handled every situation with patience and calm and believe me there were a ton of upset flyers. I usually don\\'t write reviews but they are worthy. On the other hand I called United and the women on the other end was uncaring . I told her my situation and she said pay for another ticket. I responded with I don\\'t have the money, she said \" well then I can\\'t help you\" and hung up on me. It was then I went to the counter and the agents helped me. I was given a hotel and food for the night (which was very much appreciated ). These women under such stress handled it amazing. As far as United itself I am not sure of future use.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Tampa. I was skeptical about trying United Airlines again since I had bad experiences before. The pilot did everything in his power to get us out of ORD early but alas we got out late due to traffic on the tarmac. Not their fault. So when I landed in TPA, I was in a rush to get off so I can get my dog and go home to sleep since I had work the next day. Once I got home, I realized that my iPad was not with me. I call the United help line, which they werenâ€™t much help. Then as I was trying to contact TPA again, United called me. I described my lost iPad and they said that it will be locked up for me to get. Great customer service.', 'united airlines Not Verified | If I could, Iâ€™d give United negative stars. My flight from Raleigh to Sacramento was canceled and when I called United about changing the flight, they rudely told me that they have nothing to do with purchases and to call whomever I purchased the ticket from. When I did finally get a new ticket, I was booked on a 6.5 hour flight back home which left almost 30 minutes late and damn near made me miss my last flight. The service on this flight was so awful and sterile, they offered drinks once during the entire duration and food you could purchase. My last flight (also United) left also 2 hours late. 100% would never recommend United to anyone.', \"united airlines Not Verified | San Francisco to Austin with United Airlines.

When I was at Ottawa my flights from Ottawa to Chicago and Chicago to Indianapolis both got cancelled. I went to the gate and the agent collected my boarding pass and the information on my flights. After that she assured me that she will rebook my flight to Indianapolis. Suddenly, she got up and made an announcement about passengers moving upstairs to rebook their flights. As the passengers were told to follow the person leading the way upstairs, she followed behind. I was with her as she clipped my boarding pass on her card board. Then when we reached upstairs I was still walking with her slowly matching her pace. We talked on the way and she only assured me that I am not to worry. I reminded her that my boarding pass is with her and she simply handed me my boarding pass. I was now the last person in the queue. I waited for 2 hrs 30 min for my turn. She was around but my turn fell in with the other representative. I explained her my flight details and college scene again. She first told me that she will book me in the flight to Indianapolis via Washington. Then she told me that she will not be able to do that because I have two separate bookings and that she is not able to merge. In fact, she also told me that she will not be able to provide me with an accommodation when the passengers right next to me on the other counter same class ticket and same flight were being provided accommodation because they spoke on the helpline phone number.

Would love to be more rewarded for loyal costumers more.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Boise to Denver. How a company with such disregard for the consumer experience can survive is beyond me. Cancelled / delayed flights, overbooking punishing those who bought the tickets most recently (often due to emergency), absurd fees (flight change, baggage, minors traveling alone), and shoddy customer service (canned dismissive responses when you bring up concerns) make using this airline unbearable. I have sworn to never fly them again regardless of the cost difference. It is not worth it.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to Houston. We planned a normal flight and didn\\'t realize there was a difference from \"basic economy\" and economy (let it be known when leaving this review there isn\\'t even an option for \"basic economy\", just first class, business class, premium economy, and economy), and when I arrived for my flight I was forced to check my bag because a carry on and a personal item are not included, only a personal item. This forced me to pay an additional $30 for my already expensive flight. I would not recommend this airline to anyone unless they are planning a short trip where they don\\'t need to pack actual cloths, otherwise you\\'ll be blindsided by the additional fee(s). I\\'ve flown with several airlines and have never checked a bag, all other airlines allow a personal item and carry on. No one should be forced to read through all the fine print to realize a personal item and carry on is not included on an economy flight. I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone and will not be using their services in the future. 1/10.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Hartford to Tampa via Washington. Worst airline ever. The staff is rude, nobody cares about the passengers, etc. I bought a ticket and was not told I would have no choice of seat until after it was paid for. I have an anxiety disorder and of course was given a middle seat. Knowing I was going to have a panic attack, I tried to resolve this before the flight. Needless to say, United could have cared less and needless to say, I sure indeed had a panic attack in the middle of my flight. It was humiliating and could have been avoided if this airline cared. I will never fly them again, I don't care how much I have to spend next time!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Dallas Ft Worth. Backward airline that struggled to meet customers needs. Simple flight delay from Oâ€™Hare, delay was nearly 2 hours. I requested a rebooking to OKC, and would deal with my car issue myself. I was told that OKC was too far and out of range for a transfer, but was offered Houston and San Antonio. Honestly, was not even sure how to respond to this backward logic. Looking at other reviews I am not surprised by the lack of service provided. Just to be clear, my flight was delayed due to maintenance required on the plane. Again, I do not understand how this â€œsneaks up and is unforeseenâ€\\x9d.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Los Angeles. United is the worst. We bought economy tickets thinking we were getting a good deal. When we showed up at the airport, it turns out our ticket includes a personal item only, no carry on. Who travels across the country with just a purse? Our options were to pay $400 for the privilege of carrying on our carry ons or $120 to check them, meaning adding an extra 40 minutes to our thanksgiving commute. This is horrible customer service and basically extortion - we were left with no choice but to add a huge amount to our already expensive tickets. Never flying United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Mexico City to Chicago. The flight was perfect. The crew were very kind and helpful, but the food was awful. I ordered pancakes, and I was told that they didnâ€™t have anymore (business class) but the only thing left was scrambled eggs (powdered yolks) . So I ordered them, and as soon as I had the first bite, I had to spit them as quickly as I could out of my mouth because the taste was so terrible. Why canâ€™t they make an effort to give good tasty food ? My wife and I were flying business class, but the food was not second, not third, but tenth class. I think that the airline should give the passengers what they pay for, and believe me, itâ€™s not cheap. I hope that this review will be read by some authority working in United Airlines.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Denver. How is it that all pets on all other airlines, except United, are $75? Why does united charge $125? That is more than my own ticket. I am trying to understand this and this price is one way! So now my dog cost me over $300! Double what I paid for my flight. This is outrageous, never flying United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orange County to Chicago. It's getting difficult to tell the difference between United Airlines and the real low-cost carriers, United is becoming even worse low cost carriers! I actually have to wait in line to verify that I don't have any â€œcarry-onsâ€\\x9d or I canâ€™t get my boarding pass. I am a â€œpre-checkâ€\\x9d passenger! I actually put Spirit ahead of them in the common sense category! This is crazy and unprofessional for such a legendary airline!\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to London. My flight was delayed for over 7 hours. The staff were very hostile during the process of delay. We were transferred from one gate to another, we went to several gates, still, no aircraft to fly us to Heathrow, until after 7 hours. We were given a website to voice our concern, I did. No one from United Airlines customer care bothered to contact me. Rather I was sent an email to confirm if one of their agent's contacted me. I responded no. I have not heard from United Airlines since then. Poor service.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Charlotte to Honolulu via Newark. My flight started out fine it was a morning flight leaving from Charlotte, that was the best thing about this review. From Charlotte I was heading to Newark, from Newark to Honolulu. Once we arrived in Newark we had to stay on the plane for over an hour after we landed due to weather, and a medical emergency at our gate we were supposed to dock in. Causing me to miss my flight, not a big problem as it's usually pretty fast to get another one booked. I went to the customer service desk where there was about 50-75 people in front of me with only on agent working, she was the only one there for an hour and half. It was during this time that I received an email saying my flight had been delayed by 30 min and I could have made my flight, well when I got to the gate there was nobody there and the door was shut. During that time what appear to be the manager was just standing there watching the situation not doing anything. I called the customer service line where I was on hold for an hour or so before they finally answered. From there they we're able to get me on a flight the next day and didn't offer to put me in a hotel or anything for the night. After I got my flight rescheduled I was given a number to call to get my luggage transferred over. After all that I received an email telling me my new flight had been cancelled and to make another one, this time I received a link to make things go by faster, I was able to get a flight arriving at a pretty late time the next day (they had already taken 2 days of my time off) so I called the luggage people again to get my bags on to my new flight, they said it wouldn't be a problem. Well now my bags are lost and I just missed 2 days of my vacation. I will never fly United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to Denver. What a joke of an airline. I was forced to fly United because there were no last minute southwest/Alaska flights where I was going. Now I know why everyone says donâ€™t fly United. Pretty sure their employees get a bonus for being as incompetent as possible. They donâ€™t tell you that you canâ€™t carry on a bag unless you buy a more expensive ticket. Had to wait in line just to pay $40 to check my miniature carry on bag. Not a single person expressed any sort of sympathy or understanding. I will never fly United again and I hope they go out of business due to their poor decisions as a company. What an awful airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sioux Falls to Chicago. I used to fly United often, until their performance became intolerable. Every now and then I fly them out of necessity and I am reminded why I need to keep avoiding. This flight departed an hour late. Upon arrival we waited another hour on the ground for an open gate. Save yourself the pain and stay away.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Cancun to Houston. Watch out for â€˜basic economyâ€™. This means you cannot even have a carry on with you. We had a carry on and they charged an extra $83 at the gate to pack it. They also purposely separate people flying together to get you to pay extra to sit together. The flight was not cheap even booking weeks in advance. Never flying United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Kona via Denver. RDU-DEN smooth flight, one beverage service. Seats for Economy reasonable comfort. Attendants were smiling. No inflight entertainment, used own personal device DEN - KOA (757), seats were cramped for a 6 1/2 flight. PAX in front reclined, we could not move - we were under 5 ft 5 inch in height. Pitch was 31 inches. Worst part was the cleanliness of the plane. On the previous flight, some one vomited into the seat back pocket (row behind us). When the current pax attempted to clean the tray table, the smell was horrible. Flight attendants did temporarily move the pax in that row until workers could clean the area. In the meantime, we were inhaling the smell and germs for about 30 minutes. Beverage service (water) was offered 3 times during the flight. Attendants were courteous and pleasantly smiling. Inflight entertainment was seat back, complimentary earbuds offered by attendants. Varied and large selection of movies, TV shows and audio. Movies were about 3 months from original release date. Rating - RDU to DEN 8, DEN to KOA 2', 'united airlines Not Verified | Charlotte to College Station via Houston. There was an over head door in first class with a broken hinge and maintenance took 20 minutes to get to plane to put duct tape on. Then we had to wait 40 minutes to take off. Being an hour late to Houston we missed our connecting flight to College Station. Now we have to wait almost 8 hours for a flight. Also we had to call the boarder for our dog to cancel pickup tomorrow and cannot take care of our outside livestock and pipes in sub freezing weather. United attempted to appease us with 2 x $10 food vouchers. Will never give them me business or money again. United totally dropped the ball on this.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Austin to Washington via Chicago. Does flying economy means going through different customer service attitude? When you pay more they smile and if you only pay economy they are the worst with you? Cause it sure feels that way. No carry on, $30 to check in a luggage that could totally fit under the seat but since youâ€™re only group number 5 well, you cannot have more than a purse with you, seriously? Also, if the plane is everything but full, do I still need to put my purse in my computer bag cause otherwise I canâ€™t board the plane? Yes of course! otherwise you would be treated like a number 1-2-3 but you didnâ€™t pay for it so let me give you a hard time for fun. Any way, expensive, rude and such a pain to fly with United. Good luck to all future travelers that dare to be just normal and pay only for economy.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Minneapolis to Chicago. I paid extra to sit in Economy Premium. I was shocked to see that I had to board with zone 4. By the time I boarded the plane, there was no room for my carry on. I only found room about 20 seats behind where I was sitting. If I had know this would have happened, I wouldnâ€™t have paid the extra fee. There is no point paying extra when you canâ€™t even have your carry on close by. I called United to voice my frustration and the attendant didnâ€™t seem to bother to hear my story and she hung up the phone on me. I will never fly a United again and I will not recommend it to anyone I know. I will gladly pay for a more expensive ticket with another airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Taking a returning flight from Guatemala to Houston and then a connection onto London (all with United Airlines), my arrival into Houston was delayed by 20 minutes at landing due to a plane breaking down at the gate. No instruction was given to connecting flight passengers as to how we should proceed. Alongside several customers on the flight, we had under an hour to clear border control check, hand luggage check and get to the gate (this was at least a 10 minute walk away from the baggage check). At Border control, staff were very rude at a clearly stressful point. When told about my situation, they just told me to join the back of the queue. I was told to speak with a United Airline representative, but no employees were working at the time. Three different individuals I had asked throughout this entire process gave no care. I even tried to join my friend at the back of the other queue and was told to go back. He managed to get on the flight. At baggage check, the queue moved at a steady pace but once my bag was on the machine, there seemed no urgency with getting checks through the machine. Machine stood at a standstill for about 10 minutes. When one of the employees was asked by a couple next to me about the hold up, they laughed and just said they were waiting for another person to monitor the scanning. After my friend had informed the check in desk of my situation, I arrived at the gate 1 minute (8:16) after the flight departure time. I was told by United airline staff to join a long queue of people waiting to speak to customer service. The customer service desk was next to my flight gate at E2. This was an even greater example of the poor customer service on display as I began queuing at 8:18pm and was not served by a customer service employee for the airline until 9:10pm. Up until 9:00pm They had one employee serving all economy travellers and one other serving premium. There was no employee around to even speak with customers waiting in the queue. At roughly 9pm they finally brought out 4 more employees. After eventually being served, the staff was very helpful in clearly a stressful situation. Rather concerning was the fact her colleagues seemed to be more interested in talking about their diets and whether they could have some of the chocolates out on the desk than serving the long queue of dismayed customers in front of them. After receiving my hotel and food vouchers at 9:29pm, I decided to grab some food and go across to the Marriott Hotel. After thinking this experience could not get any worse with this airline, I was informed that the credit given for this hotel did not even cover half the room rate. I was given a voucher for $57.33 and the total room amount came to $139.23 ($81.90 deficit). As an airline that is meant to uphold strong customer service qualities (this I read in my magazine on the returning flight to Houston from Guatemala - they even had a page devoted to it in the magazine), I can safely say in the last 18 years of flying all over the world that this was by far the worst experience of customer service I have ever seen. Fortunately I received my bag, but was then lumped with a costly train journey to get home as I was originally meant to be going in the car with my friend who caught the earlier plane.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Madrid to Cincinnati via Brussels / Newark. Will not give this airline one more dollar of my money! My daughter flew home from Madrid, Spain in July. When she went to retrieve her checked bag at Newark airport it never arrived. To top it off because they had scheduled her flights so close together she missed her connecting flight to Columbus. The only positive thing about this whole fiasco was the nice gentlemen I spoke with that rescheduled her on a later direct flight arriving in Cincinnati. That was a two and a half hr car drive but oh well. By the time she arrived in Cincinnati there was still no trace of her missing luggage. We filed the claim and were given approval for $300 to purchases necessities until her bag arrived. It did arrive 5 days later minus a brand new Gucci belt ($360 value) that my daughter purchased in Madrid. Once again we filed a missing item claim. We filed our claim with receipts for all the purchased items and proof of purchase for the belt. Guess what we received in the mail? A $100 check and a $200 voucher for a future flight reservation. They didn't even give us the original $300 to cover the purchased items that they had promised. I've sent a follow up letter that I'm sure will receive no response so all in all we were reimbursed $100 for $660 lost. Great math! I can promise you the $200 voucher will go unused.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Killeen to Houston. Last night, I have tried to print my boarding passes from from their website yet the system told my that I needed to obtain them from the airport. Arrived at the airport, one one of their employees refused to give them to me and said that I was late. A gentleman arrived 3 minutes later but she gave him his for the same flight.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | New York LGA to Houston. Departure on schedule, arrival 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Nearly every seat on the plane was taken but the overhead cabins accommodated everyone's luggage. I had an aisle seat in a 3 by 3 configuration. The rows appeared to be rather close to each other -- the small TV screens were right in front of you and the seats seemed narrower. I did not watch any shows. There were two drink runs, pretzels were complimentary. A decent selection of snacks and meals were on sale and I bought a mezze platter for less than 10 dollars -- it was tasty and filling. The two male flight attendants in the economy cabin kept the place clean and were polite and helpful. The bathroom I used was clean too. The cockpit crew kept us informed as appropriate. The flight was smooth without any turbulence. The leg space was sufficient for me. This was my first domestic flight on United in several years and I was very pleasantly surprised by my positive experience -- right from the orderly boarding procedure to the quick disembarkation at Houston.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Dallas to Newark . Staff very rude and uncooperative. Flying United Airlines first time on an international route and even before boarding my experience with them has been below par. I donâ€™t think I will fly them again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I had an awful experience with United Airlines flying from Houston to Greenville. I arrived early to my gate and without prior notice, the gate changed. I did not receive a text or email notification of this change. An hour prior to departure, the screen in the terminal read the Gate at which I was located. When we were not boarding, I realized the gate had changed (within the hour). Long story short, I missed my flight and the crew did not acknowledge their lack of communication during this time. I am not impressed with the professionalism and service of United and will take my business elsewhere.', 'united airlines Not Verified | United Airlines delayed my flight from Sacramento to Madison because they didnâ€™t plan to give their crew enough rest. Rebooked me on an earlier 5:45 am flight but did not tell me. The text they sent told me my flight was at 8:15 am. Something like this happens almost every time I fly United. Iâ€™d choose another airline, but United has a near monopoly at many regional airports. Even the crew were complaining and surly.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to San Jose via Chicago. Overall, the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. On my flight I shelled out nearly ten bucks for a cheeseburger which was nothing more than a microwaved rock, very dissatisfied. Total ripoff. No wifi or entertainment. Upon the plane parking in San Jose, I and many other travelers were left to walk down the street totally blinded about where to go to get our bags. Multiple terminals later and on the verge of tears, I found the baggage claim across the street. I donâ€™t even have words for that. As someone with asthma and other health issues, walking that far and not knowing where to retrieve my bag was pretty upsetting. Not cool. Try telling the family member who is picking you up that you donâ€™t know where you are however, you are walking multiple blocks to find out where to obtain your bag. I donâ€™t travel much these days however, when I do, chances are it wonâ€™t be on United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Rochester to Chicago. This is my first and last experience with United Airlines, they caused me to pay for my bag since they have different policy on their economy tickets, then I purchased two tickets for 2 different passengers and they were no where close to one another - terrible customer service at the gate. I would never recommend them to anyone, AA will be first choice from now on.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Charleston via Newark. Today I missed my sons family day because me and my wife have been stuck with no car. (In which we had reservations to pick up at 12 am after getting off the plane November 6, 2018). We didn't make it to the airport in Charleston till 1:30am they gave the car to someone else because we can't call up in the air. We have been up for over 24 hours. We are extremely exhausted and we are still sitting at this airport because we have to wait until a car comes available. Oh by the way it's 10:50 am November 7, 2018 I can't even think straight anymore so disappointing. The most important thing in my sons life and i missed it.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Angeles to Cincinnati via San Francisco. I flew 6 different times with United Airlines in the last few days and not one single flight has a working WiFi and all the staff said the same exact excuse. This misleading and false advertising they sold us a service with WiFi and they donâ€™t even have WiFi on the plane. I donâ€™t know how they get away with stuff like this?', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Amarillo to Edmonton via Denver. Worst airline I've ever flown. Extremely bad on time performance. My flight from AMA to DEN was delayed for over 3 hours which would have resulted in me missing my connection in Denver. I had to reroute through Houston and ended up over 5 hours late. Every airline has delays but I have had more flight delays due to mechanical issues on United than any other airline by a large margin, both in total number and percentage. I bring an extra change of cloth when flying United because i can never trust it will get me to my destination on the same day. Only reason I still occasionally fly United is due to limited selection of airline to several smaller airports I have to fly into for work. I would never fly United for any personal trips nor would I recommend this airline to anyone else. To me, if i can't get there by another way, it is not worth going. Even for work, I am seriously considering flying into other airports up to 5 hours away on Delta and drive from there. It is that bad.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | New Orleans to Newark. I have purchased tickets on line from United air web site in economy we got to the airport they treat us like the enemy because we purchased economy tickets then made us check in our Carry ons and charged us for them. When we tried to talk to that lady that was checking us I was told to file a formal complaint, as we were under the understanding that we can have one Carry on each. The manager walked away and would not talk to us. Just walked away like we were not there. Very rude to have someone like that to represent United Airlines, I was very disappointed in United. It took one hour and fifteen minutes just for the attendants to come around with water and that is on a two hour flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | On October 31st 2018 I had a flight booked through United Airlines to return to Baltimore from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Booking through United Airlines was the worse mistake Iâ€™ve ever made. Once we left SJD airport (Cabo) at 12:05 pm everything seemed normal until we got closer to (IAH) Houston we were suppose to arrive there at 4:30 pm to make it to our connecting flight at 7:45pm and we were supposed to reach our destination at 11:38 but the pilot said we had to go to San Antonio for a little bit until the storm cleared up when we landed in San Antonio to get more fuel he then told us that since he exceeded the maximum number of hours to fly for the day which was 12 hours that we had to wait for the new crew to board which will take about 45 minutes. So went through customs as instructed and got some food because they told us that we wonâ€™t be able to leave until 8:15 pm. While waiting the airline staff told us that they will have to reschedule our flight but they will put us in a hotel room once we reach Houston, TX.Then we start waited and they they boarded us on the plane around 10 pm to wait some more. Finally we take off around 10:30 pm and reach Houston around 11:30 and we spoke with a customer service representative and she said they will not give us a room because it was weather related but the pilot told us he ran out of hours to fly for the day. So then we got stuck staying in the Houston airport overnight waiting for our flight at 12:00pm. Then around 10:00 am I received notification that our plane wasnâ€™t going to arrive until 2:06 since they had to find a plane for us. So then I spoke with another rep and she said they werenâ€™t going to do anything for the inconvenience or even offer a food voucher. And we were stuck at the airport with nothing since our bags already made it to Baltimore. The thing that makes me even more disgusted is the fact that my cousin that flew through Southwest leaving a few minutes after us was able to get from Cabo to Houston without any delays and she made it back to BWI by 11:45 pm on 10/31 while me and my other 3 cousins made it to BWI at 5:30 pm on 11/1. This has been a horrible experience all together and the staff of United is very unorganized and they lie and tell their passengers anything to get them hush while not delivering on their promises. I will never ever fly with United Airlines ever again and believe me my family and friends will not fly with them either.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Horrible experience: We paid 60 dollars for our checked in baggage and mine was slightly over by 0.5 pounds, while my boyfriend's had almost 1 pound less weight than was allowed. We were made to unpack and repack two times until we had the weight evened out between our suitcases, which was a lengthy and embarrassing experience. I understand that there is a weight limit, but with this slight overweight in my suitcase it was really a question of whether one or two jeans go in my suitcase or my boyfriend's. Really petty, will try to avoid United Airlines in the future.\", \"united airlines Not Verified | This is not about the flight, this is about the Customer Service. I booked a flight one month ago on United to Sydney. When I went in to make a matching reservation the site stated a change had been made to my itinerary and to give them a call. When I gave them a call they said I had to pay $300 more for my ticket, they also wanted me to pay a change fee. This is not right, I did not cancel my ticket, they cancelled my ticket and I should not have to pay more when they changed my ticket and I had no say at all. I switched from Southwest to United about two years ago because I thought I got better Customer Service and flights, I was wrong, United has continually gone downhill in the last two years and I will be switching back to Southwest and any over seas travel will not be on United. They are dishonest and to not care about the customers at all.

Staff however were very friendly and food was to a good standard, regularly offered drinks.', \"united airlines Not Verified | San Francisco to New York. First, they don't use our Known Traveler Number for our tickets so we were denied of using our TSA Pre and had to wait in the regular line. Then we had to pay 55 dollars for our carry on bags since they had no overhead space (all I was carrying was that one carry-on). Prior to passing security we paid 25 dollars for a personal bag. (Someone next to us had to pay for their carry on as well and were not happy). My sister's monitor for the entertainment system did not work. I don't want to put every employee of this airline in the same pot but the ones at our gate were not professional and my sister and I heard them laughing at us while we headed down to the plane. I never write reviews. Worst airline out there.

Economy plus seats were not great - not much different than economy and the crew were bored and uninterested. To cap it all we had a three hour delay in Newark.

My wife, our 10 month old baby, and myself were flying out of Charlottesville to LAX via Chicago. At the CHO airport we were delayed due to inclement weather for a few hours. Finally when we boarded the plane, they discovered a leak. Unfortunately for us, the mechanic was a few hours away. Good thing United was able to get a different plane. But all our connecting flights to LAX were already gone. The events up to this point were likely outside of United's control. Now we were stranded in Chicago for the night with a baby. When we all went to the United customer service, the reps argued that the delay was due to bad weather. For 40 minutes! The baby was crying, everyone was angry and tired. Is it hard to pick up a phone and check with the flight crew/United? We could have been already in a hotel resting. Finally, they called and confirmed it. With unhappy face, the reps gave us hotel vouchers, as if they were making us a favor and as if we were bugging them. The hotel was a good 30 minutes ride outside of the airport area. But they had a reliable shuttle and we made to our 6 am flight without problems. Never we will fly United again. I was going home after a 4 month long Active Duty training and my family joined me at the last phase. I paid for my wife's seat out of my pocket with hopes that we would have a pleasant flight back home. By the way, entertainment was really bad.

I contacted United customer service, and they apologized for not allowing seat assignments. Window vs. aisle really doesn't matter if your legs are jammed into the seat in front of you. I am writing this to warn people that you think you're paying for a business class experience and you get a cattle car squeeze. I will choose another airline in the future.\", \"united airlines Not Verified | Newark to Burlington. This is funny, because I can't actually review the flight. What I can review is the United customer service, which was terrible. After multiple delays, our 10pm flight was cancelled for maintenance. We were told to go to a customer service booth across the Newark airport at 1:00 am, but soon found that there was no one at the booth. The gate agent had just led us to a place where no one could help us. I got on the phone with a very kind customer service agent who couldn't help me - all the flights for the next two days were booked. We cancelled our trip entirely and were told that we would get a hotel voucher - but there was no one there. Instead, we ended up trying to find a hotel on our own because they said we could send a receipt in. All the hotels were booked in a 20 mile radius, so we took a lift back to my apartment in Philadelphia, which cost $150. I called the next morning and was assured I would get that money back. I submitted a form, and an agent online assured me that all I had to do was submit another form. I tried to submit that form, couldn't because I didn't have a valid ticket because I had gotten a refund, and called again a month ago - when I was again assured I would get reimbursed. It's been a month and I have heard nothing from them. If you like wasting money, having people tell you nice things with no follow through, and getting stranded in New Jersey, United is your airline. If you want to get to a destination, walking would probably be a more efficient use of your time.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Fresno via Denver. Very upset with United Airlines. We had a four day trip planned. Both of us had to take days off work without pay. We got to the airport and a flight attendant for United Airlines never showed up. Because of this our flight was delayed 2 hours so we missed our connecting flight. There were no immediate flights to our loaction. We should have been in California by 9.30am, we didn't get there until 4.30pm that day. We lost a whole day of our vacation all because a flight attendant didn't show up, we were punished. I want to see United Airlines make it right and credit us tickets to use in the future. Very displeased and upset. First vacation we have taken in years and we lost a whole day because of one of their employees.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Detroit. Was sat next to a man who took up his own seat and half of mine - aren\\'t passengers like that required to buy 2 seats? Then the flight attendant proceeded to offer the guy (who was much shorter than me and sitting next to a normal sized person) an open seat in the emergency exit row for \"more leg room\". Did she ignore me on purpose? I\\'m not impressed.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London to Houston. This was the 1st time I flew with United and sent them a message on Facebook messenger. an instant reply and after a discussion they kindly upgraded me to an economy Plus. Flew from Dublin to London (LHR) with Aer Lingus and was met a United Representative on disembarking the flight due to my short connection time which was an hour I was fast-tracked through flight connections and security. Instead of walking from the main terminal building I was driven right up to the gate where the United flight was parked. As I entered into the satellite building the boarding staff were professional and took consideration that I was deaf and allowed me to pre-board before everyone else. The aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 reg N78009 and it looked like it was ageing so it was. The seat for 22L was comfortable but as it was a 10-hour flight the extra leg room was worth it for the comfort if you are 6 foot tall like me and it is a good seat as I was happy with the legroom and a good whole window to yourself as seat behind me did not have a window. Despite that, the 20-year-old aircraft (almost as old as I am), the actual flight was smooth no problems was very impressed with the attentiveness of the crew and was well looked after with drinks and snacks for a 10-hour flight. The meal was Thai Green curry and dessert was chocolate ice cream. I was very impressed with the airline, the crew and was beyond expectations for me. I would definitely fly with United again from London (LHR).', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United Airlines policy for a flight cancellation or change should be considered usury. I paid for something called â€˜flight protectionâ€™ which should have protected me in case I needed a cancellation or change. But instead of a refund you get airline credit. Credit you can only use if you spend an additional $200.00. I feel like Iâ€™ve been taken advantage of and robbed but have no other choice since I need to make my trip and canâ€™t lose the money Iâ€™ve already spent. If youâ€™re flying, choose any other airline, even if you must make stops and canâ€™t fly direct, itâ€™s still better than to fly with United, who will take advantage of you if they have the chance!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I never have a bad word to say. However for the first time in my life i am going to write a negative review on United Airlines. Firstly I accept responsibility in booking economy ticket and not understanding that I could not take a carry on bag. I was relocating to Florida so i had all my belongings with me. I found out i could not have a carry on and then found out the cost of my carry on would be classed as an excess bag so i would be charged 150 dollars for the smallest bag that i could have put under the seat of my chair on the plane. The supervisor wouldn't help me i asked could i upgrade my ticket so i would be aloud a carry on. One kind lady said she could help me because everyone could tell how ridiculous it was to pay 150 for a tiny carry on. In the end i almost missed my flight while was waiting for the one agent to refund the 150 dollars. I was in tears at this point and none of the agents cared that i was about to miss my flight. Eventually made the flight Took the bag on the plane as a carry on and checked my bank today to find they took the 150 dollars. They put me thru misery and were so rude to me and then i thought well at least they done a nice thing and refunded me the 150 dollars and then i check today and they had put the charge thru afterwards.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This is by far the worst airline in the US. I have flown on it multiple times and every time I regret it. The seats are uncomfortable, they always delay and cancel flights and their staff are not helpful at all. Today I arrived at the airport with my sister and asked if I can check in with her. They refused, checked in my bag (under weight) then weighed her bags and realized that hers was over, but by then we didn't have mine to shift the weight. We moved way out of the way and attempted to move things to the carry on, but their employee just stood above us insisting we go to the designated bag opening area and refused to understanding that our flight is close to departure time. Then I literally ran all the way to the gate and told them my sister was on the way and their first response was to look for alternative flights, an option I had to insist on rejecting. Now I'm sitting on the plane and it's not even moving, they're doing maintenance work.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Philadelphia. My complaint is with customer service and lack of response. Both my wife and I are Mileage Plus Explorer members for several years and were charged $25 each way for baggage. The process to get reimbursed is now approaching two weeks and nobody with any common sense can correct. $25 each way is not a big deal but can't imagine how a major problem would be handled. As a frequent flyer with United will be taking my business elsewhere and giving away my miles so I don't have to deal with incompetence\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Singapore to San Francisco on the Boeing 787. There were numerous seats that were empty, so I had the whole row of 3 to myself. The selection was good for the in flight entertainment. The adjustable tint windows are a good touch. The food/beverage service was the most rushed I have ever had on any Int'l flight. Rather unprofessional to rush the passengers on a long flight like that. The dinner sucked too with this noodle chicken concoction that was awful. The mid flight snack was a very small sandwich and half a kit Kat. Also the socket for phone charging below the seat didn't work. Overall flight was good with the exception of the food/beverage service.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Honolulu to San Francisco. Seats: 3x4x3. Extremely cramped and limited space for luggage in your seating area. Does no accommodate all body types, it feels like they think everyone is 5\\'4\" and 150 pounds. This is a 5 hour flight and no entertainment unless you download their app on your smart phone. I do not recommend this airline at all. I have flown countless times all over the U.S. and in Canada and Mexico. This is without a doubt the worst airline I have come across', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cancun to Houston. Really poor service towards economy class passengers. I donâ€™t expect first class treatment but I do expect good customer friendly service because at the end of the day I am a customer too.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Jose to Pittsburgh via Denver with 39 mins connection time. I kindly asked the flight attendant about my connecting flight to Pittsburgh. I was concerned whether I could make my connection. She then asked me â€œWhy would you book a flight so close to one another?â€\\x9d in a disrespectful tone. How does that address my concern? Itâ€™s no oneâ€™s business. Moving forward, I would appreciate if flight attendants would answer the question they are asked and address the concern.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I am writing this letter furious with United Airlines for what I am being put through without my consent. Yesterday I arrived to my flight 25 minutes prior to scheduled boarding time. I find out I could not get my bag on the flight because the cut off is 30 minutes prior to boarding. Missing the cut off by 5 minutes and with no other flights out that night I agreed upon taking the morning flight out. I arrive to the airport at 5:20. I walk right up to an agent showed them my new boarding pass and he then pointed his finger to the kiosks and told me I had to go over there. My boarding pass then does not read on the kiosk so I then have to wait for the one man working all of the kiosks In the airline while The agents continued to talk amongst themselves behind the desks. Finally the man comes to help me and then tells me I have to check in with an agent and my flight is leaving in 30 minutes to get my bag on. I walked to the desk and quickly explained that I need to get this bag on that I am going to miss my flight. I Demanded someone to Help me and another lady told me that she could help me so I ran over to her. She put mne on the next flight without telling me and checks my bag. I am now running through TSA and get to the gate at 6am to see the door close and I begged them to open it back up and they told me you are already put on the next flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to New York. Sitting at Denver airport, flight is 25mins late. No announcement or update from anyone. The crew are just as confused as the passengers. Not a great start.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tucson to Houston. I'll try and summarize, my actual review I wrote was over 5000 characters. Both of my flights were canceled, the one coming home forced me to get a hotel in Houston. Trying to get questions answered, I called, emailed, left voice messages, and all I got was I can't help you try another department. I paid for the front row both direction and was given a ticket towards the back of the plane. Even with the confirmation email in hand I had problems getting the seat I requested and paid for (they were empty). The planes had no entertainment, no radio, nothing, I would have been fine with this if the ticket wasn't $500, but more in line of $200. Both flights were morning flights and the served cookies as the snack, really who wants cookies at 8 am. The flight crew came by once to hand out the cookies and a tiny drink just enough to get your mouth wet craving more and once to collect trash at the very end of the flight. After countless attempts to get answers and solve my issues I had to threaten a credit card dispute to get a response. What did the offer? A worthless voucher that would have cost me more money if I could have even used it.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Baltimore via Chicago. I have flown for over 40 years with many, many carriers. Sometimes you see how a company performs from small things. I flew recently short distances with Southwest. Friendly staff, carryon allowed of reasonable size, no cost for changes and 2 or more bags to check for free. Today I am flying United from Milwaukee to Baltimore via Chicago. I get to the airport with a standard carryon bag (has fit in all carriers I have used) and a little bag that vould fit inside the carry on if they only allow one piece. The measure at the counter fits but you cannot carry it on, the lady says. Well, I can put the larger in the smaller but no that is bigger than their â€œstandardâ€\\x9d measures. I am forced to check the bag in and have to pay 30 USD. Also, this â€œairlineâ€\\x9d splits the economy in economy and basic economy. With the latter you cannot pick your seat, check in on line and cannot bring a carryon that fits criteria for all other carriers. And when I told the lady at the counter about what the rest of the world does because they like their passengers, they even argued with me. Well they lost a customer for my lifetime at least. One can argue that is just one customer, but customer care starts with one customer at the time. Farewell United Airlines. You have managed to lose me and my family as customers for ever!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Omaha to Raleigh. Horrible, horrible experience with this airline. After having to reschedule due to a hurricane my experience with this airline was awful. They kept me waiting at the airport for six hours after delayed by my flight twice and then they ended up putting me on an entirely different airlines plane. Of course it didnâ€™t have any of the amenities I paid for and was probably the smallest plane Iâ€™ve ever been on in my life. Staff were rude and seemed like theyâ€™d rather be anywhere else except work. I understand why though because if they treat their employees anything like their customers I wouldnâ€™t want to be there working for them either. Take my advice try a different airline. Youâ€™ll save yourself a lot of stress and hassle.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Everything started with us missing our flight because they only had 2 officers at immigration when 3 planes came in. We of course didnâ€™t make it on time for our flight, when we asked United to help out at least with a free hotel stay they said it wasnâ€™t their problem. I think if one of their guest misses a flight because of migration being so irresponsible for not having more officers well at least United should help out their customers. We went to pick up our luggage for the flight that will now leave tomorrow and it took 3 hours to get our luggage from them. United has the worst customer service.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Houston to San Jose. United Airlines flight had poor customer service, made me pay for a purse when I had flown Spirit to Houston and my bag fit under the seat easily. Quality is poor, I was terrified of flying Spirit but they surpass United easily. I hope more companies challenge the old airlines.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Las Vegas via Washington. Worst airline I have ever flown, total rip-off. Itâ€™s a wonder that they donâ€™t charge you with a boarding fee and waiting area fee. Iâ€™ve never encountered a intercontinental flight where you will be charged for baggage! And if you have a short stopover you will be charged again! Checking in baggage for a 10 hour flight is 60$ and for a 3 hour flight 60$ again. Needless to say that you have to pay 25$ handling fee every time. So for a round trip you have to pay 240$ excl handling fees for 1 suitcase. And 1 pound to much will cost you again. Total Rip-off! The service is poor, the quality of the aircraft and food is bad, and their staff is most of the time unfriendly. I fly a lot and I urge anyone having a chance to choose your airline not to go for United Airlines, especially if you fly outside the US.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Newark to Tampa. They picked our seats by the bathroom twice. United puts families last. This is my last United flight. Worse than any experience Iâ€™ve ever had. We need a good company to step up and put these cheap airlines like United out of business. Ones that make flying somewhat pleasant. They are pathetic.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Fayetteville to Boston. Our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue so we were unable to make our connecting flight. I rebooked to Raleigh with the help of a very patient and helpful employee but it was not an easy process. The entire system was shut down so he was unable to rebook on the computer and had to do so over phone. He was also not able to print a customer service voucher for our taxi to Raleigh because of the system being down as well. Not a great performance by United Airlines software developers. Hire better.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew from Sydney to Houston non stop. Ran out of white wine during the flight. Ran out of breakfast omelette and only had cornflakes left towards the back of the plane. Had an internal flight Orlando to Houston earlier in the day, was abused by a steward for not standing up to let a passenger sit next to me although I had turned to the side to let her in. We were told entertainment was free through our phone, but it wasnâ€™t. On return trip dinner was indistinguishable, was called chicken but was mixed in with cheese, pasta dish was also undescribable. A â€œsnackâ€\\x9d of a par baked turkey roll was dry. Once again omelette ran out 3/4 of way down plane, alternative French toast was terrible. The entertainment was good though and easily accessed.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Charleston to San Francisco via Chicago. By far the worst airline I've had the misery of using. My flights were delayed with no forewarning. I had a delayed flight from Charleston to Chicago where I missed my connecting flight. Then my flight got rebooked for the next day so I had to sleep in the airport. Then the flight the next day was delayed. Now I'm returning from San Francisco to Houston and my flight is delayed again, with no other flights leaving from Houston to Charleston today so I guess it will be another night at the airport. I will never fly United again nor would I recommend it to anyone.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Newark. We were scheduled to leave at 6:40pm on 10/07/18. We boarded late and were not notified at all. It is currently 7:47pm and we have still not left the ground. Apparently their is trouble with a â€œnavigational computerâ€\\x9d going down. Then we were told that they could not find a route for us. I understand that these things happen but for the price we paid we should not be over an hour behind on our departure. This is completely unacceptable and unprofessional. We will not be flying United again. I wish I could give a 0 score for all categories.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Buffalo via Chicago. I purchased my tickets several months ago specifically to get advanced seating because I am 320 pounds. My flight was changed going back from LAX to BUF. My assigned seating was taken away and currently I cannot assign a seat to myself for the changed flight. I called customer service about this issue and they could not help. This is the worst service ever. I will never use United ever again.', 'united airlines Not Verified | London to Newark. A big shout out to United Airlines. My girlfriend I got round trip tickets to the UK through Primera Air. After arriving to the UK, we found out that Primera Air went bankrupt and we would be stranded in the UK with no alternative way home. We read online that other airlines would be offering discounts to those effected. After calling multiple airlines to no avail, United Airlines was the only one that accommodated our situation. They offered us discounted tickets and we were able to make it home. I would like give a big thank you to United Airlines for helping us get home with no inconvenience. Thank you United Airlines.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Houston. I booked first class a week ahead of time. A week later we rushed to the airport and still arrived an hour early before they boarded the gates. Right when we were at the desk they told me I couldn't bring my pet to first class. My mom had to argue with someone over the phone but since our time had been wasted and we were now in a hurry I had no choice but to downgrade my first class seat to economy. Not only did I end up wasting 150.00 usd but they also charged me an extra $75 to downgrade. The luggage were also suppose to be free for first class but of course I also got charged for them. While I had to literally run with two heavy carryon bags over to my gate my mom spoke to a customer representative and she was informed that a lot of their clients bring pets to first class. She even told my mom that we basically got scammed. We were trying to complain about this issue with the people working there but they have blatantly ignored us and made nothing but excuses. Service is not only really rude but they are basically scammers. We now have to argue with some people over the phone so I can get my refund. I highly recommend that you choose a different airline if you can. I hope to never do business with united again. Even my bad review doesn't do enough justice for these scammers.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to San Francisco via Chicago. Unacceptable customer service at counter. Flight attendants exceptional on flight from San Francisco to Portland. United now punishes you for choosing economy by not allowing you a carry on and charging you $30 per bag that you are mandated to pay or not fly. So every economy ticket is $30 more out of the gate. And if you are in a rush due to traffic car rental drop off etc., and get to the gate with bag that you have already paid to ck online, you will be charged $30 more for not taking time to check it which if you did take time to check it you missed your flight. We rushed to the counter for check in with mobile boarding passes in hand. They were three ticket agents and no one in line. and we were told they would not check bags because we were three minutes past cut off. There were five people in the security line and we would have made our flight if we had gone straight to the gate. Instead They rerouted us and that plane was delayed by two hours and at this point we do not know if we are going to make our connection and get home tonight.', \"united airlines Not Verified | First left an hour late from SLC then when landing sat on the tarmac waiting for a gate for an hour which made us late for our connecting flight by 5 min which they could have held but didn't. Then to top it off they put us on a later flight and even though I paid for assigned seats ended up having to argue with customer service who didnt even apologize and was rude and very short with us. Very disgusted with this airline will never use United Airlines again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Beijing to Chicago. Overall pretty good though United Airlines has a problem with lack of professionalism displayed by their FA\\'s. The food and IFE were pretty good. The 2-4-2 cabin configuration was a bit cramped but not too bad. Seat comfort was ok though storage space was limited. This was a Polaris class flight BTW. We got off to a bad start before taking off when of all people the lead FA grabbed my wife purse to store it without saying a word. When my wife said she needed meds for her purse the FA turned this into power trip asserting her authority. I spoke with her before take off and told her we did not appreciate her approach. After all its not her purse and a simple explanation would have been in order vs. turning this into an argument. I also reminded her we had spend \"a lot of money\" for these Polaris biz seats and expected proper courtesy. To her credit she apologized and was most attentive during the rest of the flight. However I heard two other FA\\'s gossiping about passengers with backpacks in a demeaning way. Unfortunately the FA\\'s as a whole have a long way to go on terms of professional behavior. They could learn this valuable lesson from star alliance parties like ANA, Asiana and Thai whose FA\\'s show true value towards the passengers.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to New York. I had a small personal item and suit. They asked me to check in one of those items because they are both considered personal items. I usually travel AA, but for unavoidable reason I had to fly United airlines for this trip. I have used other airlines with the same situation and they always give me a break because itâ€™s just a suit and goes in the hanger closet. So I shoved my suit in to small bag because I didnâ€™t want to pay for such inhumane thing. Even the FAâ€™s at the gate seemed rude. This is the last time Iâ€™m flying United airlines. Never again. Very disappointed.', 'united airlines Not Verified | No room for carry on luggage was very inconvenient! We were not even the last group to board and they forced everyone to check the rest of their carry on luggage without letting any of us use the space under the seats in front of us to store necessities. I only had one carry on item as did my husband and was not permitted to attempt to fit it on the plane. When we got on the plane it was probably over 100 degrees and miserable. I saw plenty of room under the seat in front of me for my bag. I was reduced to carrying around my necessary medications and items in a trash bag so I wouldnâ€™t lose anything. Very disappointed with this experience. Step it up United. I think incentive should have been offered from the beginning to those willing to check bags in order to not have this issue if it is known that your plane cannot accommodate the permitted carry on items or that people should be required to only store one item in overhead and one under the seat. Fix the problem.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Honolulu. As I was checking in a bag I arrived 3.5 hours before my departure time which was 2.05pm from San Francisco to Honolulu. We were then delayed 2 hours because the WiFi didnâ€™t work. We had to sit on the plane whilst this was being fixed. Then we got onto the runway and a passenger in the seat behind me noticed a panel on the left wing was flapping, the air hostess said sheâ€™d check it out with the captain and then she came back and said â€˜this isnâ€™t right, the captain has said he needs to check it outâ€™ - we were on the runway how did this not flag up before! This fault then left us delayed 1 hour, then 2, then 3 all the way through until 1.40am in the morning. I was offered a full refund - to which I wanted to take - but I was told that there was no way my checked bag would be leaving the aircraft so itâ€™d be flying to Honolulu without me. This was the start of my travels so that bag had all my possessions in, including my medication! I was told I would not be able to retrieve my medication or bag! I explained to them that I wanted the refund as the delays were beyond a joke, to the extent that one of the managers from United airlines said â€˜this has never happened to United airlinesâ€™. In the end we took off at 2am, I felt very forced to stay on the flight and I was told I would be compensated. The customer care team offered me a measly $150 e-ticket for another united airline flight - i explained how I am from England so I wouldnâ€™t be able to use it. And in any case $150 wouldnâ€™t get me far! I asked for the cash refund that I was originally offered hoping that someone in the customer care team would understand my frustration - but no they didnâ€™t care at all. The e-ticket offered is laughable - my flight cost Â£270 which equates to about $350 so this $150 offered is a joke. Shame on you United Airlines , poor communication and poor customer service.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Denver. The gate attendant told passengers that purses were considered a personal item and that my carry on luggage needed to be checked. That has never happened to me before and I fly frequently on United from Denver to Chicago all the time. I got on the airline and asked the flight attendants if they changed something and told them what happened and they both stated that is was â€œpersonal preference to the gate attendantsâ€\\x9d as to what items can be brought on or not. I would think it would have to be based on the airplane itself? She was very rude and it should be a uniformed response.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sao Paulo to Houston via New Orleans. United Airlines has the worst customer support in regards to missing baggage. My wife has been told for the past week that another passenger retrieved her luggage from the terminal carousel and that this passenger would likely have to return her bag in order to retrieve the proper bag since it was the only one left. We were told this for nearly a week. Then today we find out that the next day from the initial missing date, that passenger sent his brother to retrieve the luggage. Best part, luggage was given with first securing my wife\\'s bag. This guest claims his brother did not grab any other luggage. We are told this a week later when prior to today we were told that we were waiting for this guest to return the luggage. This is beyond unacceptable. We were given no update that this had occurred until a week later! Their solution: file a police report so they can \"process\" the claim and access camera footage. This is unacceptable. My wife had priceless sentimental items from her family in Brazil that she will never get back. Thanks United your outsourced customer service was so helpful in making our life miserable for a week before we found out the truth.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Eureka to Los Angeles via San Francisco. I'm a bit disappointed. I spent a lot of time planning my trip down to see my mom, who has terminal cancer, only to find out the day before that my flight is cancelled. I had to reschedule for two week out, and lost my deposit on my hotel because of the short notice. Now, I have to wait two weeks more to see my mom, when she could pass at any time, and shell out even more money for a hotel. Not cool, United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Every time I have flown United in the last four months (5 separate flights) the plane has been delayed. This last time, it was delayed 2 hours leaving and coming back we were stuck on the ground right outside our gate for 35 minutes. I understand that often there are issues outside their control, but it seems unlikely that 5 times within the past four months was all out of their control. When there are problems they are not transparent and give very little information about what you can expect going forward. Up until now I have been flying them because they have had the best prices, but I would much rather pay more and not have to deal with this as often. And if this does happen with other airlines, I am always given more information. Not worth the money Iâ€™ve saved.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cancun to Seattle via Houston. Worst airline Iâ€™ve ever dealt with, we were delayed an hr and a half. Rushed through customs ran all the way to the gate showed up 15 minuets before departing and where denied boarding. Costumer service refused to help us with 3 little kids left us with 3 little kids to sleep in airport with no vouchers or any help, and they lost are check in bags. I fly all over the country for work and have never had any airline treat customers so poorly. Itâ€™s sad they are allowed to stay in business. All I can say is never fly United they donâ€™t care for the people who keep them in business.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Munich to Washington. Reviewing United is not really easy. It is a huge airline and it is just not fair to judge them by just one experience. Fortunately I flew United in a couple of opportunities so I am able to provide a couple of reviews. In this one it is about Biz Class on an \"old\" B777. Well it is just one D Experience. Having a Biz Class with 2-4-2 configuration is just not serious. Seat too tight to sleep. Plane is quite old. Too many passengers for a crew that is however very nice. Food is decent. Entertainment is very good. Overall not very comfy for Biz Class flight. Look for B787 Dreamliner Review for a better customer experience.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to San Francisco. This is my second time flying with United this month. My first flight 2 weeks ago from San Diego to Seattle was delayed because of \"traffic control \" delayed at the airport waiting area and then once we finally were able to board the airplane they delayed the flight again. Lost of people were on connecting flights and they did not offer nothing more than to wait at the airport. Luckily on that one I didn\\'t have a connecting flight. Now here I am again flying with United because who would of think their \"traffic control\" is a regular issue for them often. Again flight is delayed and this time I have a connecting flight that I might not make it on time. Their solution, \"there is a possibility the other plane will wait for the passengers connecting to that flight\" well my departure time for my second flight is 10:10 and I am arriving for my connecting flight at 9:58am. Unless I fly (not in the plane, like literally) I dont see myself making it to the flight. So I will be in stand by until God knows I will make it to my final destination.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Flight said it offers Wi-Fi. No Wi-fi was available! Flight attendants were only able to serve half of the plane the complimentary drinks. Incredibly uncomfortable and there's no leg room. Also the flight attendants were absolutely rude. I will never fly United again!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Very small plane and totally uncomfortable for a 2 hour flight. The company had the gall to offer premium seats. The economy seats are terrible. Now I know why I love Southwest Airlines.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Very disappointed by United. Their online booking system didn't process our reservation correctly even though I received a confirmation email for my purchase. They never acknowledged that their system was faulty and blamed it on my bank 2 hours before boarding. The bank confirmed that the transaction went through and still United told me there was nothing they could do about it. I then bought a new ticket in front of them and the same problem persisted. Again they blamed it on my bank. Long story short the customer service is completely clueless, they treat you like you a nuisance and won't even apologize for their mistake or for wasting your time. Highly not recommended.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Mumbai to Los Angeles via Newark. Both segments had B777-200, but with different configurations and vastly different travel experiences. The B777-200 from BOM to EWR had 3-3-3 configuration with an old seat-back TV screen. The 31 inch seat pitch was inadequate for a 15 hour flight. The one advantage that United has over Air India on BOM-EWR route is WiFi. Unfortunately, the WiFi was not working, and United compensated me with 2,500 bonus miles. The food selection was average, and the timing of meals was puzzling. Instead of serving dessert after dinner, the flight attendants distributed sandwich and Kit-Kat bar. The B777-200 on EWR-LAX route was in 3-4-3 configuration and had no seat-back TV screen. The seats on this B777 were much slimmer. There was no complimentary meal service on this 5.5 hour flight. Overall, a very disappointing experience.', 'united airlines United is a waste of time and money, at this point. My first flight was from Toronto at 6:00am to connect with my next flight to Chicago to finally take my last flight to Puerto Rico at 7:30am. Something came up with the airplane and I lost my flight among other people. Not only that but they also gave me new flights and three 10$ \"Vouchers\" at Chicago waited a few hours to head to Miami. I got not long ago to Miami and finally head back to PR. Lovely thing they are. They sent me to the wrong terminal D3 that heads to London, not PR! My terminal was really at D40 and when I tried to use the vouchers to finally eat something since I have been flying since 6:00am till now 8:05pm the three vouchers where expired. Since the 20th, today is the 22nd. Thank you , United. I refuse to waste money on this airline in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown for having an issue with time. Tonight another delay of 2 hours. I have flown Delta and Southwest the last couple of years without a hitch. 3 times in the same time period United has issues. Last time for me. United can take a long walk off a short pier.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Roanoke via Oâ€™Hare. Very disorganized. Late boarding because incoming flight was late. Boarding stopped mid-way through due to thunderstorm, which never materialized. Delayed disembarking in Chicago because bridge was not working. No snacks because they forgot to board them in Houston. Missed connection as a result. Re-routed to Charlotte. Departing gate was as far from my arriving gate as possible, which seems odd since it was the same airline. Most of the staff were on the rude side. Gate for Charlotte trip got changed. No drinks because route was too bumpy. Arrived in Charlotte, sat on tarmac for 10 minutes. Just received email that 1 of my 2 bags didnâ€™t make it to Charlotte. Might be ok, though, because I only checked in one bag! Overall, not a pleasant experience. Wasnâ€™t really treated like a customer (despite all the printed propaganda surrounding me telling me otherwise). Not sure how they stay in business unless they are all like this, in which case Iâ€™m glad I donâ€™t fly that often.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Bismarck to Norfolk via Chicago. Flight left Bismarck late because ticket agent was hand keying the tickets, so we missed our connecting flight. Instead of a 45. Min layover it turned into a 5 hour layover. Then our luggage isnâ€™t in Virginia when we land. Still donâ€™t know when our bags will be here. Do Not Fly United! The most unorganized worthless airline Iâ€™ve ever flown! Iâ€™ve even flown Tower Air (military contract) and theyâ€™re better. I only wish I could give them a zero out of ten rating, but the lowest is one.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Louisville. Me and my family missed our flight due to the chaotic and confusing directions not given, but rudely yelled from staff while entering customs. Everyone in customs was confused, the staff was very unfriendly, yelling directions and arguing with people who did not know where to go or what to do making me sympathize with foreigners entering this country for the first time and receiving this type of hospitality. When I approached several different counters in the gating sections to ask for help, several desk employees walked passed me multiple times, with knowledge I was there for help as they were more interested in conversing amongst themselves or being on their phone. This was a terrible experience as the staff alone are all incompetent, rude, and very unhelpful. I refuse to fly with United ever again.', 'united airlines Not Verified | My flight from San Francisco to Honolulu had a delay of 12 hours until the middle of the night. At the beginning, we boarded the plane and waited for 3 hours for differents reasons until they told us that the plane had a problem so we had to get off. Each hour since 5pm they called at the microphone a â€œlittleâ€\\x9d delay of 20-30 minutes and by now, I heard those â€œapologiesâ€\\x9d and excuses too many times. Itâ€™s midnight and we arenâ€™t sure that the pilot will make it for 2am. Itâ€™s definitely my worst airline experience by far and I wonâ€™t ever fly again with United Airlines for sure!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to Chicago. Horrible airline. Had to pay for carryon bag. Despite over fifteen open seats in the middle of the aircraft, passengers were not allowed to move unless they paid a ridiculous up charge. There was no sense of trying to do good to the customer, only trying to get as much money as possible at every opportunity. Will never electively fly united again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Knoxville. Attendant was rude and lied about why I couldnâ€™t bring my small bag on because it had wheels. First he said it was an FAA regulation, then he tried to tell me it was a weight and balance issue, both false. I carried the same bag onto the same plane CRJ-200, 3 times in the last 4 days. It wasnâ€™t until this last leg home that I ran into a problem! It would have also fit under me seat, but he wouldnâ€™t budge! If they are flying under United, all regional carriers should follow the same rules! What a pain!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Before we booked our trip, we called the 800 customer service number to inquire if United offered discounts for retired military for baggage. We were told twice that two bags can be discounted (free) and show proper ID at ticket counter. When we were arrived, two staff members said that United did not offer free baggage and we had to pay $50 for two bags. We budgeted this trip and chose United because we didnâ€™t think we had to pay for baggage so this was very upsetting. Then, our flight was delayed in TPA due to a flight attendant having the wrong schedule. It was announced they were trying to find a different employee but were unsuccessful. Then it was announced that we were delayed due to federal law of not enough time between flights for staff so thatâ€™s why they had to find a different staff member. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6:55 and we finally left at 7:40. We asked about our connecting flight in IAH and the gate employee said oh youâ€™ll be fine, but donâ€™t stop on your way to the gate. We had to walk very fast from terminal C to E and arrived at last call for boarding. This made this trip quite stressful instead of relaxing as what a vacation is supposed to be. To be continued for the trip back home, not a good experience either. Wonâ€™t be traveling United any time soon.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Atlanta to Newark. Horrible experience. The flight was basically empty I had no one else sit on the entire row with me and they would not let me bring both my book bag and suit on as an item under the seat. They started I had to pay 25$ and it had to be checked in as cargo because the flight was \"full\" and there was no space - all they care about is making an extra buck and not their customer service. Never flying with them again I\\'ll pay the extra $ for Delta next time.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to San Francisco. Save yourself from hidden fees and humilitation: Never fly United. I think itâ€™s no coincidence that all the airline horror stories I and everyone I know have have been with United. Their staff make up crazy rules about baggage - even small bags and backpacks - in order to secretly charge you more money, and I say sometimes because sometimes they tell you these rules and sometimes they donâ€™t, every single staff member apparently has a different set of them. I have witnessed how they make their customers disassemble electronic-quipped bags in front of the boarding door, or made me stuff a cumbersome item into my backpack (to try make me pay for it) when later I was told itâ€™s perfectly fine for it to be in my travel bag. Long story short, never fly United, and please tell your friends not to as well. You will be much better off paying $20 more for an airline that will not charge you hidden fees and not humiliate you. United is a terrible company.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I had a connection flights but my original flight from XNA got delayed by 2 hours.

Now whenever I have to travel I look for optional flight instead of United airline.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Maui to Atlanta via San Francisco. This company is a joke. Scheduled our fights 5 months in advance. They keep changing the times, the dates and now telling us we may have to stay overnight, due to their issues in refueling in San Francisco. They changed our departure by 2 hours and 20 minutes. Then they tried moving us back to coach, when we paid for upgrades seats. We get to the airport in Maui to be told our departure is going to be delayed even longer and they can not guarantee we will make our connecting flight in San Francisco to Atlanta. I would give them a zero. These people really need to get it together before no one flies with them.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Los Angeles. We boarded at 7:30 pm everything seem to be ok and we were on the run off ready to take off when he captain announced the plane has to returned to the gate due some mechanical problem, we were repeatedly asked to stay on the plane. After almost 4+ (11:30 pm) hours we were told the plane was fixed and that we would be taking off. 30 minutes later we were told they didn't have any flight attendants because they have to check out due â€œlong hoursâ€\\x9d and if we waited a few minutes the replacement flight attendants were in the airport and on their way. After another hour of waiting we were told they couldn't get flight attendants and deboarded the plane. I was in lne trying to get in to the earliest flight posible and ask for arrangements to sleep since it was almost 1:40am airline personel where rude, refuse to make areangements to reroute baggage to my flight because there was nobody to do it at that time... they also told me as a local i was not entitle to accomodations they asked me to go home and return at 4am to board my new flight for the rest they keep telling people not to stand in line. United was completely unprepared, how could they not know if the repair took longer than 2 hours their flight attendants would time out. How did they not already have a back-up plan in case the repair took longer than 2 hours. they had plenty time to Make arrangements to help passanger they left stranded althdought they wait until last minute when everybody in the airport was gone, i even findout the flight was delayed until next morning by checking online before they announced it. Customer service is unexistant... even over the phone people lied to me with different stories and promises they knew they were lies, my luggage arrived late at my destination dispite several employees assuring me it was going to be on my new flight... on top of experience rude employee in IAH the phone personel are useless and several hung up on me.. nobody care how much they abuse passangers. Several of the United staff were clearly upset and they just stopped helping people and when I finally got to the front I was treated poorly. Every single employee i talked to redirected me to either complain online or file a form that could â€œpossibly award me a compensationâ€\\x9d within 10 business day after the incident. This airline has no sense of respect and value of peoples time and money.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Oklahoma City. Terrible personnel out of the Chicago Oâ€™Hare Airport. Would not let me board the flight, gate attendant stated she saw me chanting (cheering for football, not yelling) in the sports bar across from the gate. Missed my morning meetings and basically got told by United Airlines Management to screw myself. I can assure you I was of no concern to that flight and will never ever again waste valuable money flying your airline. I wish I had the exact names of the individuals so someone who knows how to operate business at United could try and help solve their desperate need for people who donâ€™t have massive power-trips by use of authority they have zero of. Bunch of goofs. I will never book a trip with United Aurlines again.', 'united airlines Not Verified | New Orleans to Indianapolis. I was very concerned when I broke my foot a few weeks before or trip and had surgery. I was non-weight-bearing and had a knee scooter. We called United two nights before the flight and they immediately did everything to be accommodating, changed my seat for free, changes my husband to be near me, described the process for boarding and leaving plane. We boarded four flights on that trip and everyone acted amazing, it was so easy, I am so grateful. Would definitely fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Denver. First off customer service is terrible. Everyone was telling us something different and we could not get a solution for anything. We had a flight going from Los Angeles to Denver from there to our final designation which was Columbus. Our flight was delayed due to mechanical issues four and half hours which we would miss our other flight. There were two flights with Delta airline that would get us there on schedule but no one was willing to help and made us wait 2 hours so then we couldnâ€™t make that flight. Now we are having to take an overnight flight which we did not want and we get nothing in return for this crisis. We even have to pay another baggage fee because we got transferred to a different airline. I would never fly this airline again in my life nor recommend this airline to anyone I know.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | The plane had a mechanical problem, we were repeatedly asked to stay on the plane.

After another hour of waiting we were told they couldn't get flight attendants and deboarded the plane. When we got off the plane we were asked not to stand in line and that they would call us by name and that they would give us a hotel voucher so we could come back in the morning to fly. After waiting more than an hour they asked everyone to get in line, then they ran out of hotel vouchers so had to sleep on the floor. United was completely unprepared, how could they not know if the repair took longer than 2 hours their flight attendants would time out. How did they not already have a back-up plan in case the repair took longer than 2 hours. I was second in line when they asked us not to be in line, why would they announce for us to get out of line and then tell us we have to get back in line and then tell most people, sorry there's no hotel. Several of the United staff were clearly upset and they just stopped helping people and when I finally got to the front I was treated poorly. I was asked why am I here and when I told them about the flight delay they said they didn't know anything about it and that they had just got there. I asked for my hotel voucher and they had to check to see if they could help me. I received a hotel voucher and by the time I got to the hotel there was enough time for 2 hours of sleep. United did a terrible job of managing the situation.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Phoenix. Where do I begin, I canâ€™t even find anything positive to say! The worst airlines ever everything was bad. Very uncomfortable seats and extremely rude staff.

Iâ€™d never fly with United ever again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Edinburgh to Charleston via Washington. The flights to Edinburgh were ok but the planes we were on were very old and filthy. I used the warm towel they provide before the meal service to wipe off the center console between the seats and it was black. Yuck! The flight attendants were nice and the food was fine. Our return flights were not good. Our transatlantic flight was cancelled but we were not notified until we were standing in line to check in. We got a nice hotel room amd meals and the flight the next day was on time. But again the plane was filthy, the blanket smelled like body odor and had holes in it, and the wool throw smelled like a wet dog. There is no way those had been cleaned between uses. Again the center console was visibly dirty. I paid almost $5000 for this? The flight attendants were unfriendly and we were made to feel that we were an inconvenience for them. Our connection was in Newark and the plane we were supposed to leave on was diverted to another airport. Flight was delayed for hours while we waited for another plane. That one was United Express and that plane was very old and the interior was not maintained. My husband wents to the lavatory at the back of the plane and said there was a crack in the interior plastic. Part of my armrest was missing. I have to wonder what the state of the mechanics on these aged planes is like if the interior that is visible to the customers is so bad. I will avoid United Airlines whenever possible in the future. Think twice before you book with them.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Lufthansa/United failed to put my luggage on the airplane in Munich, for some unknown reason. Despite filing a claim, my luggage was still sitting in Munich three days later. Eventually, they flew it to Charlotte, NC where I had stayed one night upon my arrival before traveling onwards. I called every night to track the progress (or lack thereof) of my luggage. Even though I had updated the address from the address of the first night\\'s hotel to the new location, every single time I called they had the address of the first night\\'s hotel. Three days after my luggage arrived in Charlotte, I called for the 7th time because I still did not have my bag. They told me it had been dumped off at the hotel where I had stayed 5 nights before, despite the fact that I\\'d updated the address over and over. So now my luggage is at some hotel I stayed at 5 nights ago that I am not planning to return to. After an hour on the phone with United this evening, he\\'s told me (for the 5th day in a row) that I should have my bag by tomorrow. United is incompetent. Over and over I heard them say, \"I apologize for that, ma\\'am.\" It would seem that they\\'ve all be trained to deal with issues in this way, rather than by actually sorting them out. Very, very unhappy with United/Lufthansa and not fly with them again, even if it means paying extra to fly on another airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Philadelphia. The plane was delayed because of a warning light about a fuel pump after the flight was fully loaded. It then took 20 minutes to get a mechanic and another 20 minutes to figure out the warning didn\\'t matter and we could fly anyway. \"its a redundant system\", they told us. The experience was made worse by the fact that there was no air conditioning during the period of the delay on a hot day in Denver. The airplane was not cleaned after arrival in Denver from San Francisco. I was stepping on crackers left on the floor and there was garbage left in the compartment on the back of the seat. My family flies UA regularly but this had me thinking I should look for alternatives now whenever I can.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tokyo Narita to Hobbs via Houston. I traveled alone with my 10 month old daughter both ways. No flight attendant helped me out in any way like putting luggage up in the cabin, picking up her toys for me, or even just being friendly. Everyone treated me like I was a hassle to deal with. One attendant refused to give me my bassinet because service had started, even though I had already been waiting for an hour. It only takes a few seconds to latch it on. One flight attendant actually made eye contact with my smiley daughter and waved, which was nice. One Japanese male attendant who I spoke to in Japanese, replied to me in English even though (he was speaking Japanese to the other staff so) I know he spoke Japanese. Why not speak back to me in Japanese? That is just plain rude. Other than that, after experiencing JAL last year, I thought the food was extremely disappointing. I also specifically made a phone call just to request a bassinet, but when I went to check in, there was no such request. I was baffled. I canâ€™t say how disappointed and annoyed I was about the staff on both flights. If you are traveling alone with an infant, they will treat you like an inconvenience.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Perfectly clear day. No weather problems.

I hate to fly with them but this was the only option this time.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | After arriving at the airport at 4:30am in San Diego we flew into Chicago. Little did we know we would not be leaving that airport for 36 hours. Our flight to our destination was scheduled to leave at 6pm. After our gate got changed 10 times and our flight got delayed further and further we scurried up and down stairs to each one. We then arrived at the last gate at 9:30pm. We sat and sat and were told no updates. We then were told we were waiting on the plane to arrive that we were flying out. The plane landed. BUT we only have one pilot, so we waited for another plane to land for a second pilot. Thenone of the flight attendants timed out on her shift and could no longer board our flight home. BUT by the time the other plane landed the staff timed out as we watched them walk right out of the gangway to the plane passed us never to be seen again. So, we waited on another plane for a whole new crew. We were assured for the first announcement over the intercom of the night that we were heading out soon! At this point it is 11:30pm. 30 minutes later, at 12am, we are notified that the flight is cancelled. after waiting 9 hours and running around the airport, it is canceled. This is not even the worst of it. We call United customer service to see what can be done 2 times (go ahead and listen to those calls- they are pathetic) only to be told there are no more flights to JAX and that we cannot be helped. The couple in front of us got another flight booked automatically that left 6am the next day why our customer service experience was so different is beyond me. We ended up buying the only flight we could in a different airport. We ended up purchasing a flight from MDW in Chicago to JAX. Sometime after purchasing the flight I was so relieved to find one! That is until I realized the flight I purchased from Delta airlines was on September 27th when I need to leave ORD right then and there on now what is September fourth. So with even more stress added, I am out over $500 more dollars, I still have no way home, I have nowhere to stay no way to travel, I donâ€™t have my luggage, I am defeated. So, after searching for some more time, there are no flights out of ORD to JAX for 2 more days. I ended up purchasing another flight for $935.60 from a different airline and airport in Chicago that did not leave until 1 pm the next day. We were left with no other choice but the sleep on the ground. So, it is now 1:30am. We are wondering where is my luggage that has everything I need in it and were told our luggage went to JAX already without us. It didnâ€™t make sense. So, we then stood in another line and were told that our luggage is at ORD but if we exit to get it, we cannot get back in until the morning. So, we agreed to get our luggage in the morning before we spend another $40+ dollars to transfer to MDW where our new flight is.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cedar Rapids to Toronto via Chicago.

Then when trying to see if we could get a partial vs full refund depending if we canceled our trip vs still going they said those seats for the next day were now gone! Forget it what a joke! They were so quick to take my money but didnâ€™t refund me for a checked bag I didnâ€™t even take because of the cancelled trip.

If a representative is taking pain to go through the reviews (which I highly doubt), itâ€™s high time to change your employees. What angered me was not the delays or inconveniences of last minute gate/terminal changes. That I can handle. What irked me was the sheer arrogance and attitude that each one of your employees show towards customers in general-especially the ones at Chicago Oâ€™Hare. I am yet to come across one who is civil and decent enough. As customers, we shouldnâ€™t have to deal with your employees attitude and sarcasm. I give this airline zero stars. Nowhere else have I felt this poorly treated ever in my life.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Seattle. What a joke of an airline. The staff is rude and unprofessional.

I will never fly them again and I suggest you do the same', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Raleigh Durham. Flying United once again was a horrible experience. Even though a passing storm stopped several hours before the departure the outbound flight was cancelled. I had to go to a university to attend classes for one week and when I checked in on the rescheduled flight, the flight attendant made me check my luggage even though my luggage basically met the carry on requirement, which caused me to be late to my class though my rescheduled flight left at 6am and I had plenty of time to get to class by 9am. One the way back my flight was delayed 4 hours though only a 1.5 hour flight. Once I got back to my airport, because they made me check my luggage again, I was delayed another hour since the luggage were put into a room without alerting anyone. United airline operates giving zero consideration to the customer\\'s time, paying good money. Their attitude seems to be \"\"we are doing you a favor\"\". The attendants are rude and I have never flown out on time nor reached my destination on time. United new carry on baggage policy is a scam. You have to board basically with nothing with you unless of course you pay more. It is a shame how United treat their customers so poorly and without much dignity.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Pittsburgh to Denver. It wasn't enough for United Airlines to make your life hell on the plane, they've overachieved and ruined your day before you even check in! I got to the gate to check in and immediately was informed I was restricted. Yeah thanks for alarming me. Then I'm notified my flight was delayed, but received no notification that this happened. Great, now I'm at the airport 4 hours early. But then it gets worse. I researched the night before and United states you are allowed a personal item and a carry on (sizes are listed) but they don't mention that it depends on the class. If you have basic economy you forgo your free carryon rights and must pay to check it in. Now they've put a damper on my day, trip and wallet. Then my flight was delayed 2 more times just to really kick me in the knees. Bottom line, I would much rather give my nonprofit salary to any other airline.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Medford . The flight was fine but we paid a lot of money and still had to pay more for baggage and to go on an earlier flight. We also paid to get premium economy so as to have a bit of leg room. The airline check-in was a nightmare. We were coming in from overseas on a different airline and had to re-check bags and get seats. There were kiosks, which I assumed were for checking in bags only. We wanted to try to get an earlier flight so I started to approach the â€œadditional servicesâ€\\x9d counter. However, the attendants started yelling that the counter was only for missed flights. The whole time we were there, the people at the counter were yelling at everyone to use the kiosk. There was no-one there welcoming us and answering questions, they assumed that we should know their process and yelled when we didnâ€™t. After being in the UK and experiencing the polite service there, it was disappointing that one of our major airlines is so rude to customers. Frankly, I would rather fly Southwest where they will be polite to me and wonâ€™t â€œnickle and dimeâ€\\x9d me like United. Unfortunately, few airlines fly in/out of our little airport.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Wichita to San Francisco via Denver.

Wide spectrum delays on United flights as a rule, come to find out, especially on the planes from Canada. The planes are old and in disrepair. I will have been bounced around 19 hours and missed a full day of work with expensive parking fees at San Francisco along with now ridiculous drive time.

I ended up next to another 6â€™5 male in an already ultra-tight seating arrange (reason #1 I donâ€™t fly United). I quickly felt like the ultimate â€œcommonerâ€\\x9d no longer in 1st class when asking to change seats to one of the 3 bulkhead seats with no passenger after the main doors were closed. â€œSorry sir, only Gold and Platinum flyers are allowedâ€\\x9d is not a comforting feeling after I just spent $1165 on a last minute first class ticket!! If thatâ€™s a company policy change it! Thatâ€™s classless United Airlines. I didnâ€™t request a first class seat. I requested a poor bulkhead with the tightest legroom of any carrier Iâ€™ve flown. I think the seat would have cost me $18, but it originally wasnâ€™t available.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Seattle. Iâ€™m appalled by the horrible attitude from the ground staff in SFO. I was one of the last few to board (with 25 minutes to spare before takeoff), and was told that there was insufficient space overhead bin for the remaining passengersâ€™ bags. I was asked: â€œWill your bag fit in front of you?â€\\x9d by one of the male staff, to which I answered â€œYes, itâ€™s just clothes.â€\\x9d I was then yelled at for no good reason. He said â€œI didnâ€™t ask you what was in the bag, I asked if it would fit.â€\\x9d Iâ€™ve never been treated like this by service crew anywhere in the world. You would think that there would be some semblance of service!', 'united airlines Not Verified | San Francisco to Birmingham via Chicago. Never again. Given a flight with an impossible connection. No way to travel over 2 terminals in 10 minutes. Logistics planner that sequences flights sucks as does customer service.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Orlando to San Francisco. I travel on a regular basis, but not normally on United, Now I understand why! The gate agents, flight attendants and baggage workers are some of the rudist people I've ever met. They seem extremely incompetent and give you the run around if you have a question. I lost my wallet on a plane and it took me over an hour to find someone who could help me. I finally went back to the airport, which was a $60 Uber ride away to figure it out on my own. In addition, my husband was checking a firearm and it literally took 30 minutes to complete after being sent to several different places by several different people. I booked in economy because I didn't read the fine print that talked about the inflexibility of this type of fare. When we inquired about changing, they treated us like we were second hand citizens. Its not like the ticket was free, even if it was, that's no way to treat anyone. Finally, there was a child screaming at the top of his lungs on our flight and not one attendant offered any help to the mother. In addition, they didn't even insist that either of them put on their seatbelts. Unbelievable! Things look pretty in the terminal and everyone is dressed very well, however, the customer service is horrible.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | I flew on a flight from Tokyo, Narita to Denver international, coming back from a family vacation. Our flight was a total of 10 hours and 10 hours and 20 minutes long. Departing time was 5:15pm - 12:35pm. The flight price was $1,394. I gave it a average of 7 stars, based on the overall stars of 21. I feel the value for money was not where you want it to be. The flight was bearable, but not extremely comforting, there were times where I had to really get creative in the position of my body to get at least 20 minutes of sleep. Leg room was mediocre at best. A passenger sitting next to me who was a little over six foot had 0 space between his knees and the seat in front, he sometimes had to press his foot against the seat in front. Seat Comfort = 2/5 - Value For Money = 2/5 In terms of the cabin crew, they were not nice, but they were not rude either. You could tell some flight attendants were a bit rough around the edges, wanted things to be done quickly. But some were more understanding and nice, but still have that edginess. That is all okay because they ended giving out some decent food. The problem I have with some airlines is that the food is just bland, and this is the same with United, but thankfully, they came with salt and pepper, good job. Dinner meals were okay, but breakfast was great. If your settling in for a long flight, try the omelette meal if they have it, the meal is rather delicious for airplane food. Cabin Staff Crew = 3/5 - Food And Beverages = 4/5. One thing I desperately have to mention is the washrooms in that airplane. I mean I had never seen anything like it. If your a person that frequently visits the washrooms, and does not like to wait, United might not be for you. On my flight, there was not a minute that the washroom was empty. There was also somebody in it, and there was also a lot of waiting, you couldnâ€™t just sit at your seat and wait for someone to finish, because theyâ€™re people in line that will snatch thatâ€™s opportunity up right away. Man the washrooms on that flight were something I will never forget. My last topic is in-flight entertainment. I felt the roster of movies was pretty good, and I got to watch some very good movies, that are brand new. The only downside is the technology to watch it. It was a touchscreen tv on the seat, but to be honest it was challenging to use, a light press on the screen when you want to exit out will not work at all, and you might be stuck with thinking that your screen isnâ€™t working and not watch a movie for the whole flight! But instead you had to press hard on every single button to get it to work. This is okay and is a lot better than the screen not working at all, but is frustrating. In-Flight Enternainment = 3/5 Well the flight was bearable, an above average flight as you can say, and above average is okay with me on a gruelling 10 hour flight but anything below that is a nightmare. Overall this flight was what you call plain mediocre. And if you have a bit of patience youâ€™ll get though it fine, and if you donâ€™t find another flight. Bearable, Above Average and Mediocre, are things that I feel itchy about, but for a 10 hour flight I would recommend it, but the price is a little bit out of hand.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I had a flight from Calgary to San Diego via San Francisco. The flight was delayed and my connecting flight from SFO to San Diego was already left. I have to stay at the airport for whole night . No other flight was provided or even Accomodation.

My husband and I stay in airport from 10:30am until we thought our flight was coming at 7:50 only for them to announce that the flight is delayed. They couldn't offer us to go on another flight, they couldn't offer us a pillow or blanket to keep us warm and comfortable while we had to wait. Uncertain why the flight was delayed, they claimed weather, but other airlines were flying to our destination with no delays, because we had an economy flight we were treated less than.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I am a mom of 2 kids flying today from Dallas to Chicago. United asked me to reschedule the flight due to bad weather. After rescheduling my flight they sent a message stating that now this flight has been cancelled. We tried to book again the previous one but it was full at that moment of time. It's a terrible day for me, due to long weekend we had so many plans and all have been cancelled last minute. My elder daughter is so disheartened. The customer service representative will just say apologies and won't even give any benefits to you. Please don't book any flight with United Airlines if you are traveling on long weekends or holidays.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Hartford to Tampa via Chicago. First let me start by saying if United is your only option for an airline you may want to strongly consider driving to your destination, you will likely get there quicker. Second when your flight is canceled 90 minutes before departure because the aircraft is â€œnot availableâ€\\x9d United will never tell you why, so do not ever expect any type of compensation for your loss of time or other expenses. Lastly, not only will you ever hear and apology, but instead the agents are rude and act like they are doing you a favor for rebooking causing you to lose an entire day of your time. Never again my friends, and yes please do use my real name! I rarely ever leave poor reviews but this is more than justified!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Frankfurt. Worst airline in the world is United Airlines. I\\'m a gold member for many years. The airlines constantly has flight delay, extremely bad or worst customer services - bad attitude of gate agent, attendants, and all known to everyone the worst food services among all the airlines I\\'ve experienced. I fly often with European and Asian airlines, even latin american airlines, all I have received much better services than from United. This is the latest experience I had just 2 days ago traveling from SFO to Reykjavik connecting at Frankfurt. Notified in the morning of departure, flight was delayed for 1 hour 15 min. I have 1 hour 35min connection at Frankfurt originally. Got to airport, the check-in agent said the flight should take off per new time and will arrive only 30min than original. It turned out flight was late departure for 2 hour 15min, and arrived 1 hour 10 min later than planned. And got text message at FRA saying they put me on the flight next day midnight arrival to Iceland. That is 1 and half day later. I only going to be at Iceland for 3 days. Then to make things worse, they couldn\\'t get my baggage transfer to the new flight that I had switched to at FRA airport. Now I\\'m stuck at Iceland without any clothes and can\\'t get out in the cold weather. Here is the contrast, at the SFO airport, a gate agent of United, at the elite / premium line, was extremely rude. I hand over my passport and he handed back and said \"open to the photo page\". With 1 hour delay, and line up, and even at the premium line, this is United\\'s attitude. And to compare to the agent of Lufthansa airlines at FRA airport gate, the 2 ladies was very friendly, and went out of their ways to help me, and put me on a same day flight connecting to Iceland only 5 hour later than my original flight. They didn\\'t send me to the United customer service, which is what I would expect any gate agent or airline services in US airports would do. They made many phone calls while asking me to wait and took care of everything and handed over my new boarding pass and told me they\\'ve notified baggage handling of my new flights.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Charleston to Houston. I paid for a 7:00a.m flight not 8:15a.m flight. Every time I fly United itâ€™s never on time. I would recommend Delta or Southwest. United is a joke.

I cannot say enough negative things about United Airlines. This is is the second review Iâ€™ve left in the last four hours because I have very little to do since arriving in Newark. Delayed flights.

Do not make mistake I have made.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Rochester to Burlington. Absolute worst airline you could fly on. Found out our flight was over an hour delayed after arriving at the airport, however we needed to ask if this meant we would miss our connecting flight. Staff was completely unsympathetic. Gave us 2 options both would have us arrive at our destination a little less than 24 hours after our scheduled time. On top of that, the attendant was unsure if we would get a refund if we cancelled the flight. Again, completely unsympathetic. Itâ€™s 2018 United, try and figure out a better flying schedule so your flights donâ€™t get delayed. In the future, I would happily spend extra money if this means I will not ever have to fly on United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to San Diego.

However, after I took my qualifying flight, United told me that only 1,500 miles were reinstated. Given that they charged my $100, I asked for a refund since it was not worth paying $100 for $1,500 miles, but they refused. Their reinstatement challenge is a fraud so don't register for the program!\", \"united airlines Not Verified | Houston to London. Worst return travel that never happened just because they were not able to match first name from a boarding pass to the name given on the passport. Instead of checking the surname on both the travelling documents and providing every possible proof that it was a booked by a family member who gave my Arabic initial instead of my actual first name. Every personal detail I entered and gave them such as passport no. DOB, Expiration date and ticket details all matched, but they still didn't let me go through. I'm baffled and wondering as to why didn't United rectified my ticket when I have given them my passport details and all. They took me to the TSA and adding salt to my injury, they kept me waiting for an hour, took me back to United Airlines and asked me to verify her details which the customer service on the phone did, but the United Airlines rep on the desk at the airport refused to verify it. The customer rep on the phone spoke to the rep at the desk and he still refused me to travel back. They have sucked the money out of me not only for the return ticket and $100 extra for an extra luggage I was supposed to take back to London today.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to San Francisco. Worst airline to travel. They will try to suck money out of you in every possible way. They charged me extra $50 for 2 bags that were allowed free to carry on by all other 5 airlines in the itinerary. Also they insisted again and again that the â€œkind of ticket classâ€\\x9d I booked, they are doing me a favor for everything. I am not sure how they treat economy passengers but it felt insulting at one point. It was unfortunate that I booked tickets through United Airlines. But I will not repeat this mistake again in future, itâ€™s a lesson learned for me.', \"united airlines Not Verified | I was heading to Newark airport from Honolulu, with a layover in Denver. An electrical malfunction occurred on the flight causing the plan to land early in San Francisco.

I was on a small plane (2 seats per side) and I being a large man was also sitting next to a large man (probably the two biggest guys on the plane). There were 3 of 4 exit row seats open. They wouldnâ€™t let us move because they the flight attendant said we couldnâ€™t because we didnâ€™t pay for them. They were already paid for but they didnâ€™t show up for the flight. So she decided to make it an uncomfortable flight for us and then leave the exit row seats open which is a hazard.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to San Francisco. They charge you even for small carry on item. While delta allowed me to carry the small carry on bags United changed for both of them. This was the last time I did business with them.

Because my ticket was purchased via 3rd party, it was deemed group 5. I tried to upgrade from economy time of purchase and check in but it would not let me.

Even Spirit is better.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Buffalo to San Juan via Chicago. My family and I were rerouted because we missed our connecting flight in Chicago when the first flight from Buffalo was almost two hours delayed. We were sent from Chicago to LaGuardia airport in New York and told that our luggage would be sent to LaGuardia. When we arrived at LaGuardia, our luggage didn't. We filed a baggage claim and were told that the luggage was still in Chicago but would arrive on a later flight. Since our connecting flight wouldn't be leaving until the next morning, we waited at the airport and when the last flight arrived around 11pm, still no luggage. We are now left without any luggage and we will be catching our cruise at it's next port of call. This means we will be without a change of clothes and toiletries during a one week cruise. United Airlines has only given us a lot of explanations why they can't help us. The only reason we will even be able to board the boat is because we purchased new tickets through another airline. After the humiliation and frustration that we have been put through by United Airlines, I would never recommend this airline. They give you a number to call but make sure that you can't contact a live person.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Maui to San Francisco We had a flight to Kauai from Maui which we could not make due to Hurricane Lane/ fires blocking all roadways to the Kahului airport.

We had already paid for our flight, we called in to see if we would have to do anything special with our bags. Then they informed us because we wouldn\\'t be on the first plane in the flight arrangement they would need to \"cancel\" per policy and charge us additionally to schedule us a new flight, even though we already paid for two seats on a flight that is already leaving from Maui to sf which we would be on. United had \"waived fees\" for flight issues related to the hurricane up until the 26th August, but had no sympathy or sensitivity to the fact that our issue is directly correlated to the waivers they were issuing. Terrible customer service, terrible policies, terrible compassion, and overall I am not surprised with this experience given everything United has received heat for in recent history. I\\'ll never book with them again. I have to believe our experience is part of UA\\'s attempt to fix their stock price, never again. This experience was over the phone and not directly related to any flight attendants, pilots, or in flight experience.

I was flying from Boston MA to Atlanta Georgia via Newark with the flight scheduled 7:30 am with destination arrival 1:18 pm. The flight from the Boston was delayed for more than 5 hours due to thunder storm at Newark and the problem with generator failure at the gate which caused missing of connecting flight to Atlanta. After waiting in queue for 2 hrs at Newark, the boarding pass was issued for 5:40 pm that day(August 11th, Saturday). After the boarding was announced for 5:40 and the gate was opened for crew members, the plane was cancelled. There was already very long queue at consumer service there were no other options than standing in the queue because I was unable to reach customer service via phone. After waiting for line for more than four hours, the situation became very worse due to rude behavior of the customer service representative. She mentioned that next available flight is on Monday morning(August 13th) and there is nothing she can do to help. She also mentioned that hotel accommodation cannot be done as it is weather related although the flight delay from Boston was due to power failure at the gate as well. She convinced me to fly back to Boston next morning(Sunday) and forget about the family vacation or wait at airport until Monday morning. The representative walked away stating that she has other customer to take care of and asking me to make decision to wait until Monday or fly back to Boston on Sunday. It was already past 10 PM and my younger daughter(5yrs) was sleeping on my shoulder. The customer service representative did not came back to the window for more that half and hour and I walked to the next window and requested to talk to the manager. The guy at other window called their team leader who offered option for stand by tickets for next day and spend the night at the airport. I was already tired and hungry and there was no other option than crying or comforting wife and two kids. Spent cold night at cold airport floor. I was not able to get accommodated on 9 am flight on Sunday. I convinced my wife and two kids who where crying after loosing hope of getting flight. Next available flight for stand by was on 11:01 am. There was already about 60 people on standby list and I was flying in a family of four, so the hope of getting boarding pass was very minimum.

After an hour of waiting they came to a conclusion that there would be another flight the next day. United did not help with any accommodation for a place to sleep in the night for any of their customers. When I checked into a hotel that I was forced to pay for, other people staying at the hotel had vouchers from the Amarican Airlines company because American Airlines cares about where their customers go to sleep at night in the event of a flight change or delay. The day of the flight there was no representative seen at the desk gate D10 from the hours of 7am-10.30am. There was no one there to talk or help any customer until the time of boarding.

I asked him to document the conversation so I could follow up with customer service. He refused stating \"I can\\'t document activities for interaction with customers\".

I missed my connection from Newark which was scheduled to be 8:50 pm. When i landed in Washington DC, i contacted the United Representative who asked me to go Newark in the same flight which is going back to Newark and ask the Representative over there. So i have to wait to go to Newark to ask about my options. In the meantime, United didnt offer any food or water as it is 11 pm and none of the shops are open at DC and I didnt have any food after lunch. I boarded the flight in DC to Newark at 11:30 pm and again we were made to sit inside the airplane for another 2 hours before take off and reached Newark at 3:30 am (next day). I have to wait in line for 3 hours to speak to United Airline customer representative and took more than one hour to reschedule to another flight which i have to tell them what flights are available by looking from my personal phone. By the time i completed the process, it is 7:30 am and my reschedule flight is at 2:15 pm from Newark.

When i contacted Air India which was the carrier which brought me to India, AirIndia mentioned that United Airlines never handed over the bags to them. Its been 2 days after i reach and yet to receive my bags and AirIndia told me United is yet to give the bags. Don't travel through United Airlines, as this is my second worst experience with United Airlines. Exactly three years ago, i flew through United from Washington DC to Frankfurt and United made to sit in the flight for 6 hours without taking off and asked us to get out of the flight after 6 hours of delay stating they have technical issues. At that time, i decided never to take United, but this time Lufthansa asked me to take United as part of their alliance as Lufthansa flight are booked for certain dates. I was assuming that United Airlines would have changed in the last three years and would be better. To my assumption, they have changed, but worse than the previous time. Atleast last time when the issue happened, United provided accommodations and food, but this time they didn't care about any of the customers and didn't even worry about anything about their customer.

After sitting there for quite a while pilot announced going back to terminal because the plane check he just did showed a problem. We sat on the plane in the heat until they told us it would be at least an hour.

The reason they say weather is that then they are off the hook. They could only find flight to fly the following day. Now I went from direct flight to connection through Frankfurt. I had to spend one additional day in hotel, food, clothing all purchased at my cost. Unfortunately, my flight next day was also delayed. The guys in Lufthansa said that my connection in Frankfurt was fine. I missed the connection. Now I contacted United. They said it was not their issue anymore and I have to deal with Lufthansa. Lufthansa put me now through Denmark. Fine print: My flight from Denmark to EWR was standby and Lufthansa said that it was confirmed. We go to Copenhagen to find this hard truth. Called United and as expected they passed the buck to Lufthansa who passed the buck to SAS and who in turned passed it to United. With great difficulty my family and I made it back to USA, The SAS flight was horrible. Old plane, poor service, charge for even a soda. Horrible! I came back and filed a complaint with United. They make their feedback site so restrictive that you cannot explain details or upload bills properly. They dont even have a contact number to follow up. When I didnt hear back from United and called Mileageplus service, they basically said that wait your turn and we will call you when we get to it. What arrogance and callousness. Is this customer service? I have had it. I will make every effort not to fly United. But again, do we have a choice anymore. They all consolidated and ensure that they compete to provide the worst service at the highest cost possible. So much for free market economy!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Ontario to San Francisco. Never flying with them again! They made me check in my carry on, they said itâ€™s part of their policy and made me pay for it! On top of that the flight was delayed. My last time flying with them. The staff was not friendly at all.', \"united airlines Not Verified | New Orleans to Newark. This was a nightmare. Almost every single person we encountered with this airline were rude and snappy. We couldn't check in online because apparently you can't fly Economy with a carry on any more. When we asked about it at Customer Service, the employee was rude and dismissive. I understand it's 4am but there is no need for my family and I to be treated with disrespect. I have never experienced anything like this and hopefully never will again because I now utterly refuse to fly United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Denver. Absolute joke. Left us on the ground for 2 hours with no updates and no clue what was going on. Then the crew started walking around offering water, as some sort of compensation for a complete lack of communication. Never flying United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Atlanta. The worst experience I could ever imagine. I had a reservation for 5.40 pm flight to Atlanta on Aug 17 that was delayed by 3 hours - reason given was â€œlate inbound crew â€œ.After 3 hours of waiting, the flight was announced cancelled now the reason given was bad weather. The weather was fantastic here and in Atlanta from 5pm -9pm. So I donâ€™t get it. I was going for an important medical two day training course which was starting Aug 18 at 8am to 5.30 pm . So I had to get there in time. They were able to pt me on the next flight which was supposed to depart at 9.36pm but after waiting on plane for 3 hours that was announced as cancelled too due to the thunderstorm. Funny part is we waited on flight for close to 4 hours and the storm now had passed but they could not fly as crew had timed out! I luckily hD no checked in baggage but the folks who did were asked to come back next day at 6 am to pick it up. They were not ready to give out baggage to passengers for whom flying the next day was not an option... again because their crew had gone home. It almost felt like their crew had to rush home once the clock struck a certain hour otherwise they would turn into pumpkins like in the Cinderella story! Then one of their crew members has the audacity to talk to all the stranded passengers badly - He tells us , \"this happens. Crew has gone home, we are humans not machines, we need to go home too! We canâ€™t give you bags today. Come back at 6 am\" Just unacceptable! I will never fly United again - if you are fond of being mistreated and insulted, this is the airline for you!', 'united airlines Not Verified | Denver to Philadelphia. A 6 hour delay was the absolute worst experience of my entire life I have never been so uncomfortable, and tired in my whole life. Every step of the process was delayed. We left late. Had to stop at a different airport for gas. And now weâ€™re sitting here waiting for a ground crew.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Redmond to Los Angeles. This is the worst flight experience I have had in a long time, luckily I have plenty of time waiting in the airport to write reviews. It started at the check in counter where I was informed that my economy ticket only allowed one bag under the seat, no use of the overhead bin, therefore I had to check my one carry on bag for $25. At the gate they announced that a different flight (to San Fran) was delayed 3.5 hours because they had to fly in a part for the plane from Portland. 15 minutes later they come up with a solution, the airline chose to take the plane from my flight and use it for the San Fran rout instead. Now my wife and I get to wait an extra 3.5 hours instead! My wife has to go back out of security to talk to someone from the airline, who tells her no there aren't any more flights and no we won't be compensated for the inconvenience of missing the party we are flying to LA for. Now I'm at the only airport bar where the credit card reader is broken, so no food/drinks while we wait. This sucks, we are definitely flying Alaska next time. Flight UA5644\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | A horrible airline. Third week in a row flying from Chicago to Dallas on the 5am flight for business. And each week United has had â€œunplanned maintenanceâ€\\x9d or â€œschedule disruptionsâ€\\x9d with all flights being delayed 2+ hours. Get your act together United. Have flown with 5+ airlines and United is by far the worst one.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | It's been a terrible experience so far with United and Middle East Airlines getting my luggage back! Flying back home to Lebanon after a great vacation with my family in the US ended up with a chaotic return. Arriving to Beirut airport, none of my bags made it to the belt as we waited for our 5 bags. After constantly chasing United and MEA for our luggage we got 1 bag out of 5, 2 days after our arrival. A couple of days later we got another 3. It's been 10 days now and I am still missing 1 bag! Yet the biggest issue is the fact that United and MEA still cannot locate my bag! I don't understand how an established airline like United can make such a careless error! I can't express how disappointed I am that a Star Alliance airline cannot manage the basic customer service request of finding my bag. I am not sure what kind of compensation they plan on giving me at this point.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Anchorage to Rochester, or at least a sorry attempt to get me there. Leave Talkeetna, AK to drive to Anchorage for Flight ~3.5 hours. Wait 1.5 to board for 6 hour flight to Chicago. When checking in, find out Connecting flight to Rochester cancelled and I am being re-routed through Newark, NJ. No email, text, or update of any sort. Then I wait 2.5 hours for layover to Newark for 1.75 hour flight to Newark. When I get to Newark, flight status stated â€œAwaiting on Planeâ€\\x9d. From 9am- 3:30pm with countless updates saying we were awaiting plane. Updated every 30-45 mins we new departure time. Told countless times plane is on the way, plane should be here shortly, etc. 2:00-2:30pm, attendant called over speaking saying plane was being â€œtowedâ€\\x9d to our gate and to be ready to board immediately after it shows up. 3:20pm - flight is cancelled 3:30-5:35 - stand in customer service line waiting to talk to someone. Tried to explain myself and representative was very rude. Let other people cut whole line with cancellations, not just the people who were doing normal check in. Two attendants working line of over 40 customers. What does customer service do? Puts me on a flight at 10:00pm arriving in Rochester at 11:24pm and a couple meal vouchers? Seriously? What about the breakfast, lunch, and dinner I already purchased while being lied to all day about the plane â€œpulling up shortlyâ€\\x9d? Had I known this I would have gotten a rental and drove 10 HOURS AGO! I had to miss another day of work after being on vacation for over a week. I am a single father full time in work and school and never get to do things like this. I will never fly this terrible excuse of an airline again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to London. Over the last 6 months I have flown multiple times with United Airlines. I can say without hesitation this is by far the worst airline in the world I have ever flown with. I have had multiple occasions of delayed flights, sleeping in airports, damaged and lost luggage (steel reinforced cases may I add that still get smashed), rude customer service agents, missold upgrades and rude flight attendants. I have been offered a $400 voucher in compensation of all of these however when I tried to use it, they said it's not valid for anything other than booking new flights. So my existing flights that are booked months in advance, I cannot use this on. Naturally, I don't want to fly again with United so the compensation is useless. Honestly, I can rant all day about these guys but they don't care anyway so realistically there is no point. Just save yourselves a headache and stress and use a different airline, United should be ashamed of themselves.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Lima to Minneapolis via Newark. A mission group of 20 people who booked our flights two years in advanced were delayed 3 times in the matter of 32 hours beginning in Peru were we had a 24 hour delay cause the flight got delayed and the connecting flight was to close in time to our arrival. Then we got another 7 hour delay at the airport before getting onto the plane to Newark. Once in Newark the flight was delayed again because there were other delays making it so our flight attendants wouldnâ€™t get here on time. In conclusion it has taken us four days to get home when it should have taken one. Will not travel with United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Springfield via Chicago. I flew in to Chicago from Boston, the flight was delayed, by the time i got to Chicago the flight to Springfield was gone. I'm forced to spend the night and they wont even pay for a hotel. Offered me 150$ future travel voucher and a meal ticket. The voucher they sent me says if i accept it I release them of liability. The flight I was rebooked on was 24 hrs later at 9:30 pm the next night - I've had travel issues with airlines before but I have never been treated so badly with such disdain before. When i tried to ask questions at customer service the rep actually ignored my questions completely only talking to me when he wanted to.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Terrible experience. I was flying from Vancouver to Denver and I checked in hour and a half before the departure time. Even though the bag check took so long, I was still able to make it to the gate 5-10 minutes before the flight departed but they refused to open the gate for me and have already unloaded my bag. They booked me on another flight to Denver where I will have 15 h layover before the connecting flight to Madison. The plane hasn't left when I arrived and I wasn't the only person did not board. I did not miss the flight, is them who left me and probably gave a seat which I paid for away! Terrible behavior and no commitment to customers.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Not enough connection time! It happens all the time and the worst thing is that they know when you check in to your first flight that you will miss your connecting flight. The line in customer service has 2 agents and the lines are overwhelmingly long. Donâ€™t waste your time and money.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Worst flying experience Iâ€™ve ever had. Our first flight was delayed so we had to completely reschedule all our connecting flights. We made it to Houston to wait for our next flight and after waiting 2 hours our flight was delayed another 3 hours. After 8 delays/times changes for our flight and 7 hours of sitting in the airport all they did to help us was give us a $10 voucher. We asked about the delays to try to figure out what was going on and see if there was another option. We were responded to very rudely and disrespectfully any time a question was asked and were not given any sort of response besides â€œcanâ€™t help youâ€\\x9d. I will never be flying United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to San Diego. I recommend not flying with United Airlines because they have the worst time management. They boarded the passengers on the plane and were getting ready to depart. Over the intercom the flight attendant said â€œThe captain had a family emergency so we are getting a new one and he will be here in an hour and a halfâ€\\x9d. Ok, pretty normal stuff happens right? We come back an hour later, sit at our gate, and we hear the person say â€œUm, there seems to be a sudden maintenance issue that may take several hoursâ€\\x9d It was 2:04pm when they said that and I boarded at 6:25pm. Thats 5 hours (including waiting for the pilot). Do not fly united, they are terrible.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Salt Lake City. I hate flying with United Airlines. Literally every time I miss my connection flight. I would never pay my own money to fly this airline. However, I travel for work and my company I work for uses them. Probably because their tickets are cheap because its miserable every time you fly with them.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Chicago. I paid $622+ $25 for baggage, to get to Chicago ontime for a family event, the flight suppose to leave at 12 noon, first we got an hour delay due to weather issues in Chicago. Then they started boarding, since I was very tired a fall asleep, I woke up over an hour latter when people were getting out of the plane, I thought we arrived to Chicago. But no the plane moved to another gate and thatâ€™s it. We had a delay of 12 hours. I could drive for less money and headache. I would not recommend United if time is really important to you.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Los Angeles. This is the absolute worst airline. I have never experienced such disrespect in customer service before. When my flight was delayed from 10:50pm to 6:30am because the pilot decided to not show up, i tried to get help from the person at the front desk and he told me he couldnâ€™t help because he was â€œoff work and not getting paid for this.â€\\x9d Then, we were not given hotel accommodations because we were â€œlocalâ€\\x9d even though I live an hour away. Now, on the flight that has already been delayed by 8 hours we are still sitting on the tarmac waiting for the first officer who didnâ€™t account for the fact that there was going to be traffic. I cannot explain the amount of frustration I have, because I think there is a way to handle these type of situations, and United absolutely does not know how to do it. Iâ€™ve never experienced such disrespect from customer service representatives, or such a lack of compensation for their actions. Will not be flying with united ever again.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Orlando to Newark. Absolutely awful. This was my second time flying with United, the first times was a disaster, missed connecting flight due to incompetent TSA, then the new flight was delayed 4 times, i swore never to fly with them again but 3 years later i decided to give it another shot. Once again they validated their incompetence by messing up my tickets. They checked my 9 yr old in as an infant causing massive confusion, back and forth trips to different attendants, leading to the missing of our flight. They rebook us onto the next flight only to have us miss that as well because surprise! They gave us the wrong tickets again. Absolutely awful customer service. Only 2 times i have flown this airline and both times they have ruined my flights and made no attempt to accommodate us for the massive inconvenience. Never ever will i be foolish enough to purchase from United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sacramento to New York. At the day of my flight, I went to the airport and I surprised that there is a special line for New York travelers, then I knew that the airplane got cancelled! Without even knowing then I tried to find different route because it is a board exam and I wonâ€™t be able to postpone it. And after plenty of begging I was able to change my routes to SF then to NY. Both flights got delayed and we still donâ€™t know the reason! Finally, today Iâ€™m going back to Sacramento, and now Iâ€™m at the airport and received a text message telling me that the plane got delayed 1 hr and 30 min! Guys please avoid this bad airline until they improve their commitments to passengers. Because right now they donâ€™t care about their passengers as having a lot of customers. But they need to solve their issues which would be done if many of customers wonâ€™t book with this airline!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Houston. This is ridiculous! My fiancÃ© and I booked our flight together and had to sit in different areas. This made my flight very uncomfortable due to me having a fear of flying and he usually helps keep me calm.

This is not ok and I will not be flying with United airlines again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Las Vegas. My flight started with the announcement that the flight is over-booked and so someone had to leave, they offered $450, a flight next morning in first class and a hotel for the night. I didnt take it. I had boarding group 5 but somehow managed to board the plane first. Seats were actually better than at most of translantic flight, legroom was fine, width wasn't that bad too. Entertaiment screens was however just ads, so the only way to watch movies was to download the United app and then watch, but there was big selection of movies so actually a good entertaiment system, food was for purchase, drinks were free. The crew was nice too. We departed at time, and arrived earlier, we only waited 10 minutes on tarmac. I dont understand why is United so hated. I had an excellent experience.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Barcelona. The experience is horrible. The airline handled their difficulties very poorly. The did not check the plane until it was about to take of, they held us on the tarmac for 2 hours, announced a mechanical problem, than delayed the flight for another two hours, and then surprise! The flight attendants became out of legal hours - didnâ€™t they know they are delaying the the flight over and over. They put us in line for hotel vouchers, a 3 hours line to get our vouchers, this is a true torture- the flight was suppose to leave 6 hours ago- it is now almost 2 pm. Everyone is exhausted and they donâ€™t have enough stuff to put us in the hotel. Stay away from this unprofessional outfit. Iâ€™ll never use them again.', \"united airlines Not Verified | United delayed my flight by 3 hours and so I attempted to change my flight to an earlier departure as I had urgent business in NYC. After speaking to three different representatives on the phone who refused to help me, the manager of the supervisor of the original staff member I spoke to put me on an earlier flight and told me I was good to go. After arriving at my new gate, the O'Hare employee at the gate informed that I was never checked-in so I didn't have a seat on the plane and that I might not make it out. That flight was then cancelled, and my checked bag eventually flew to LaGuardia on my original flight and instead of offering to deliver it to my house, United insisted that I come back to the airport in two days to pick it up. Long story short, the customer service provided by this airline is terrible, I'm never flying them again and I can tell you if you're ever in need of help this airline will do absolutely nothing for you.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Honolulu. This wasn't the best flight I've taken. The seats were very uncomfortable and felt super hard leather. There was no exact entertainment system so instead you had to put your phone or ipad inside the holder which I didn't have with me. They didn't have that much stuff for breakfast. The United Wi-Fi was super expensive : $11 for 1 hour, $15 for 2 hours, $21 for full flight. They only offered one website free which was unitedwifi.com where for free you could stream a limited number of movies for free without being able to access the rest of the internet. I didn't have headphones so that didn't work out.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This flight was a \"United by SkyWest\" Flight From Boise, Idaho to San Francisco and then to Fresno California. The gate operations and boarding went fine in Boise, and we departed on time. The problem started in San Francisco (SFO). When arriving in SFO, the pilot came on the intercom, alerting us to a computer problem \"Only effecting Skywest flights\" and that the plane couldn\\'t, leave the gate since without the computer they couldn\\'t do anything, but don\\'t worry we would have it all cleared up in 20 minutes. 1 hour and 40 minutes later, they started to taxi around the tarmac in an effort to look like we were getting somewhere. At 2 hours we did finally get into the gate. We were told that most outbound flights were delayed so, Hurry and get to your gate and you can probably still get your connection. I rushed, I made it onto the plane. After about 20 minutes I noticed that we were not moving. Within a few minutes the flight crew arrives. The pilot announces that since they had been stuck on the Tarmac just like the rest of us, that they were about to \"Time Out:\" and that they were waiting for another flight crew to come aboard so that they could take over in Fresno. A few minutes later they announce that \"The Flight crew has arrived and they are waiting on the Jetway for paperwork.\" Another hour passes, and still no flight crew. At exactly 2 hours after closing the plane they open it again, this time to announce that since they don\\'t have seats for the new flight crew (There was 2 Deadhead crew already on the plane) that they would have to trade out the flight crew now. (Why it took them 2 hours to make this decision I don\\'t know) At this time a New Voice comes over the intercom announcing that \"If You are going to get off Plane do so Now.\" No explanation just a threatening voice, with no offer to re-book on another plane. Around 15 minutes later the captain (1st Crew) walks back into the cabin to explain what was going on and says that the new crew would be on the plane in a few minutes. Around 20 minutes later the new crew does arrive, and the Captain announces that as soon as they completed the inspection, and they had completed paper work we would be leaving, \"It should be about 20 minutes\". We all had a good laugh. I have never heard passengers catcall the pilot before. Well after another hour (The flight is now 4.5 hours late in departure) they push us back from the gate and start the plane. We eventually take off and arrive in Fresno 5 hours late.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Houston to Saint Louis. No notification of delays. Delays for over 2 hrs. Zero customer service. Never will use again. Cheapest and poorest run airline I have ever flown. I wish I could change but not even given an option.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United lost my luggage on my flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Upon arrival at SFO they told us they have found the luggage at LAX and that they will deliver it in the evening since they have a flight every hour. After we went to our house we checked with the automated messaging system and that we get a message saying that it is out for delivery. We were waiting for the whole night since it had very important item in it but with no avail. Finally we contacted the agents but they did not have any communication with their drivers to tell us the ETA. On our earlier flight from SFO to LAX they lost 9 out of 10 luggage. We received those luggages three days later at our vacation destination. We had to endure those three important vacation days without required medication and daily requirement needs in our vacation. Of course no compensation for all those pain and inconvenience at all. In my view United is in-efficient with bad management to cause me this kind of inconvenience and pain for being it's customer. I would not recommend it for anyone unless this is the only airline that is left in the world.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cancun to Montreal via Dulles. I am a frequent traveler, first and last time with United. Our flights from MontrÃ©al to Dulles and from Dulles to Cancun were OK, no more no less, had to pay for anything more than drinks. Staff wasn't particularly nice, nor rude, just doing their job. The way back, though. Another story. The flight from Cancun to Dulles was juste a few minutes late, no big deal. Pilot put the pedal to the metal and we were actually there in advance. Then our flight to Montreal was delayed. By 30 min, then 1 hour, then 2 hours, 2 and a half... Next thing we know, it is past midnight and our flight is cancelled. We waited at the ticket counter for 20 min to be transfered on another flight, only to finally have them tell us that they're re-switching us back on the same flight that they decided last minute to postpone to the following morning. Caused all kinds of problems at check-in after we spent the night at the airport hotel, since they gave the flight a different number. Needless to say the plane was 20 min late the following day. Never flying United again. Lost 8 hours of work because of their disorganization.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Medford. Flight on time, but this aircraft is incredibly cramped, even in their so-called Economy Plus. In fact, I don't think it was any roomier than any of the other seats. The interior of the aircraft itself was tattered and worn. The flight attendant was very nice and professional, but her appearance could have been a bit more polished. I realize this is 2018 and working as a flight attendant isn't a beauty contest, but certainly there's a professional and corporate image to uphold, even at United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Richmond. Just another classic landing without my luggage. Same as when i flew to Detroit, Chicago, etc. These clowns just cannot figure this not. Horrible horrible management. Never flying with United airlines again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Raleigh via Newark. I have never left a review for an airline in 30 years of travel (first time for everything). Our flight experience yesterday was pretty bad, and after dealing with the customer service today, I feel the need to write this. First, dropping our checked bags at the Dublin airport took 50 minutes which I find ridiculous (thank goodness we arrived 3 hours early). The staff wasn't exactly efficient or in a hurry. Second, our flight was delayed 45 minutes to Newark. That's fine, delays happen, but when I tried asking a flight attendant if we were in jeopardy of missing our connection, it took 30 minutes for me to even flag someone down on the flight (even though my call light was on the whole time), and she was extremely rude and short. The flight attendants in general were less than friendly, especially when I asked if they had snacks for purchase and the attendant looked at me like I was dumb and said no. Got it. We finally arrive to our final destination in Raleigh and our bags did not arrive with us. We were informed they'd be on the next flight, but since we live three hours away, they said they would have them flown to Columbia, SC and would arrive Saturday night around 11pm, and then would be delivered to us.  No big deal again, we get these things happen. Well, here we are Sunday at 10:00am, and the bags are nowhere to be found.  It took me 30+ minutes to speak with someone in customer service and the language barrier is so bad, that I still don't know when our bags will arrive or why they didn't make the flight to Columbia last night. Itâ€™s not the poor manâ€™s fault, sometimes itâ€™s just too difficult for both parties. I asked to speak to a supervisor but was told he was busy and would call me back (doubtful). I also called back and asked if I could speak with someone whose native language was English to avoid the language barrier and frustration (two attempts failed). They finally told me calls are globally routed and I'd have to keep calling until a native English speaker answered (30 min wait time each call). This goes far beyond things out of Unitedâ€™s control happening, and today finally made me realize itâ€™s just terrible customer service.  I am done making excuses for United and the people I have dealt with during my travels.  No desire to travel on this airline again. Iâ€™m flustered so Iâ€™m sure there are typos. Great trip where I got engaged and ended on a bad note. Now we need to buy a bunch of items just so we can go to work tomorrow morning.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United must be trying to coerce Basic Economy buyers to upgrade by treating you like complete garbage. One of their rude staff members even told us our experience was the way it was (very very terrible) because we bought Basic Economy tickets. The staff from the DIA ticket counter to the gate were all unprofessional and rude. Our worst flight experience ever, and we\\'ve had many flights, was on this flight. This was the first time we bought a Basic Economy ticket, although unknowingly through a popular online reseller. So to start, we found out you only get one personal item and no small carry-on. Usually we have our small carry-on and personal item, which fit just fine under the seat with room to spare for our feet. Second, there is no online check-in, you will waste your time trying like I did. Third, when you go to the airport, numerous United signs tell you to use a kiosk to check in. That doesn\\'t work either, as the kiosk instructs you to go to a ticketing agent to waste time. You have to look for a tiny little section off to the left that reads \"Economy\", where it is manned by a single representative. Fourth, once we got to the rude Economy ticketing agent, he pretended to not know why the kiosk rejected us so we had to show him. He quickly reminded us that we have the junk \"Basic Economy\" tickets. Then, we tried to hand our checked/labeled baggage to said rude agent since he had a scale one feet to his left, and he points to the other longer line and says \"it goes over there\". On to the bag line, the lady there was no better. She tells my wife in a rude tone (while also talking angrily to her coworkers), \"License and boarding pass!\" No \"hello\", no \"how are you\", not even a complete sentence, and they weren\\'t even very busy so it surely couldn\\'t have been that she was rushing or stressed out. After a very long security line wait with ultra slow TSA workers, we finally got to the gate and the door had just shut. This part was only partially United\\'s fault due to lack of online check-in and their deceiving kiosk signs which wasted a good 30 minutes of precious time. The United gate agent was completely unprofessional and bitter and lacked any sympathy whatsoever. She kept telling me, in very stern fashion, to check my ticket next time as if I were new to flying. With a reluctant look on her face and body language, she got us onto a later flight. We lost our purchased seats, and my 8 year old was assigned a seat away from our group next to complete strangers. To conclude, making United staff do any extra work is a crime so steer clear of United Airlines.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to San Juan via Newark. This airline has very poor practices, and bad customer service. Our flight between Newark and San Juan my parents and I had paid extra ($75USD each) to pick our seats by getting economy plus. Upon checking in online, we discovered that they gave up our seats, and now we no longer had seats. We then called to get our seats back. This did not happen. They instead gave us seats close to each other. Okay fine... BUT when arriving to the airport we go to print our boarding passes and again discover that we DO NOT have seats! So we have been told on the phone to settle things at the Toronto airport, then we were told to settle things at the Newark airport, and finally we were told that they canâ€™t do anything. Why did we spend about $250USD just to get shuffled around? Stop charging people for services that you are not providing. That is a scam, plain and simple. You said that it happens when aircrafts shift, but thatâ€™s your problem. I paid for this service and expect to get seats without the hassle that we have been through.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Los Angeles. 5 hour delay due to a missing crew member. Completely unacceptable and ridiculous excuse for delaying a flight for hundreds of customers. I find it hard to believe that an airline as large as this does not have sufficient crew members and back up teams. On top of everything the waiting area gate only has enough seats for 20 or so people, United decided to rip out the rest and replace them with useless iPads for gambling, so most people have been standing or sitting on the floor waiting for updates. Their on-flight entertainment is awful as well.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Rochester. The most unprofessional and arrogant experience. Flew into Newark, NJ and was immediately told our flight was delayed an hour. Several minutes later our flight was cancelled. They proceeded to line us up and tell us one by one the next possible flight was the following day and they would not be offering any reimbursement or hotel accommodations. 32-weeks pregnant at the time, I expected any sort of accommodation for the hundreds of dollars I lost in my hotel arrangements for the Rochester area and missing a rehearsal dinner. No explanation offered. Absolutely horrible customer service at the counter. Exact words from our attendant \"Mam I am not abliged to offer anything aside from a rescheduled flight at 8am tomorrow morning.\" They expect families with children and elders to stay in the horrible smelling and dirty airport for 20 hours. Despicable. Forever lost my business.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | El Paso to Houston. My family and I are never flying with United again! All their on time again and again slogans are bogus. Save yourself the hassle and your valuable time.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Phoenix to Denver.

I was told if I changed/postponed my wifeâ€™s flight, and submitted documentation from the hospital it would be a refundable $200 charge.(no problem) I canceled and tried to rebook the next day for 4 days later. Well, $200 change fee plus an additional $200 for a different day fare. Supervisor said â€œsorry nothing we can doâ€\\x9d. I ate the original fare and booked her on Frontier, only to pick her up and take her back to our local hospital. Thanks United for being so compassionate. I will never book a flight with you again.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Venice to Newark. Our 10:55 am Flight was initially delayed 2 hours and a food voucher was provided. At the gate it is announced the flight is delayed, for unknown reasons. The plane is at the gate. Many delay anouncements follow, each stating that boarding is to begin in 20 or 30 minutes. Gate agents canâ€™t provide any information on why we arenâ€™t boarding, I was told they were making an engine repair, another woman was told they were replacing a windshield wiper. After more than 4 hours of being held hostage at the gate, we are finally provided with water. After six hours we are allowed to board. We taxi to the runway and are told we are 3rd in line for take off. Then the pilot announces theyâ€™ve exceeded ground hours and we are returning to the airport. Not a gate, but a small door. United has no gate at VCE, no United employees either. Baggage is delayed for about an hour, another hour in line for hotel voucher, another hour ride to the hotel, finally eat food at 9:30 pm. Back on the bus at 5:30am. Long day, tired, hungry, upset, no explanations. Not a good way to end a nice vacation. United offered no compensation other than the 600 euro as required by law. I would like to know why the flight was delayed, what was wrong with the plane, why so many small delays and no customer service.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Worst airline ever! Never will use them again! First, I bought a ticket in May for a wedding in September, the wedding was cancelled so I called to see what I could do. I was told I had to cancel my ticket to request a refund and that it would be processed in 7 business days (this was July 6th, still 3 months ahead of the wedding date!) Then, I went on a trip from July 12-24 to Aruba, United cancelled out flight from Houston to Aruba and we had to fly all the way up to Newark, NJ and spend the night in the freezing cold airport in order to get to Aruba on time for our house check in. There is hardly any leg room, the workers are rude and very unhelpful! On the trip back we had to fly to Miami, we had to collect and recheck and repay for our luggage! $200 worth! Then, even though we had just carried on a bag and a personal item, we were told we couldn\\'t on the next flight because we were group 9! Seriously? Thankfully we had a better airline from Houston home! Then, when I got home I checked the status of my refund only to find that they \"can\\'t refund my ticket\" so now I am out almost $400 and they will be making money on the seat that I cancelled! Seriously wrong! If I was told I would get the refund, they should honor that regardless of the policy! That is misleading and theft! Worst airline ever! Do not use them unless you want to be screwed over, a lot!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My experience was horrible. I took 6 different flights with United Airlines within a 3 week period and they were never on time. Lost my luggage. I found myself running from aircraft to aircraft unable to use the bathroom or grab a bite to eat between my layover. I was upset about my lost luggage and when I entered Bangor a United employee told me to â€œchange my tone or she would call the copsâ€\\x9d. This is after I almost missed the second plane because there first one was yet again late. I chocked on the plane for 20 minutes because of how quickly I had to run to the next or I would have missed it. For the love of God avoid the steps on your vacation and take another airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Porto. I have never had an experience so horrible. The first day my flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. I came again and the flight was delayed so I was not going to make my connecting flight, so they told me I could not board. I came the 3rd day to board my flight and successfully got to Newark. After waiting in the airport for 11 hours because it was the only available flight, I had another delay in Newark. I called to try to receive compensation and was told it probably wouldnâ€™t happen because it was weather related, yet the last plane was not delayed due to weather. I was told to file online and I have and still have not heard back. I have spent money on a train and a hotel I havenâ€™t been there due to the delay and now Iâ€™m being told I probably will not be compensated. I am beyond furious and will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Venice. Never again will I fly United. This was the worst flight ever. For a transatlantic, red eye flight, the seats were unbelievably uncomfortable. The padding was super thin, the headrests flopped over whenever you brushed against them, and the recline was non-existent in economy. A lengthy delay to start my trip didn\\'t help, but that could have happened on any airline so I won\\'t knock United too much on this. I fly from NY to San Francisco a lot for work on American, their economy seats are like first class compared to these United seats. My United aircraft had the new Polaris design with smaller seats, it should be banned. The meals onboard were fine, for my son. I was jealous of his kids meal, dinosaur chicken nuggets and veggies. The adult meals, people were asking flight attendents what was in them, and the flight attendants didn\\'t know. It was either \"chicken\", \"veggie\", or \"pasta\". If a flight attendant can\\'t tell you what\\'s in a meal, would you want to eat it? Seatback entertainment was above average, they had a good selection of TV and movies. And it worked well. I\\'m not flying United ever again. Maybe for a short flight, but not for an overseas or transcontinental flight. M', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I broke my leg a week before a trip. Couldnâ€™t get my money back so decided to go anyway. First they give you absolutely no option of extra legroom seating so a week after surgery I was stuck in the middle seat for hours. Not only that, I canâ€™t walk and they made me feel like I was a complete burden. A wheelchair took forever even though we told them ahead of time we needed help. We flew Delta to our destination and it was awesome. United made the trip home 1000x worse. Like I was really planning on breaking my leg and having all the employees treat me like a joke. Never again will I fly United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United Airlines allows their customers to be trapped at customs baggage claims for more than two and half hours with minimal information. We were told that it simply would take longer due to weather twice in that entire time. No information about missing flights was given. Due to the nature of customs people are told to not get in their bags or be on their phones. It also means we are without access to any food you may have packed. Unless it was less than 3.4 ounces, we have no access to drinks. If you want to not feel like a trapped animal, pick any other airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Wichita. It was my first time flying alone so you can imagine how terrifying it is to be stranded alone being a young woman in an airport. My flight was cancelled due to weather conditions so I\\'m told but I\\'m able to be on standby for the next flight out? I don\\'t know how much sense that makes, because wouldn\\'t the other flights be cancelled as well? Especially if the weather says it\\'s only going to get worse. So i go to customer service, only for the lady to tell me my only options are to be on standby for a flight being that in the event a person don\\'t show, I get to go home ? I paid about $500 for a flight that usually costs $120 only to be told the airline won\\'t be doing what I payed them to do, their job. Instead I get a \"sorry about that \", maybe 24hrs from now I\\'ll get to go home! So I\\'m stuck in the airport until then, while I\\'m offered no compensation for wasting my time, being stranded, or causing me to have to call in to my job because the airline has failed me as a customer. Overall I\\'m still stuck and the airline hasn\\'t taken responsibility for not doing their part as a business. My experience is ruined with this airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Columbus to Newark. Worst customer service in memory. Canceled original flight (UA4443) without any notification. When I inquired about what happened, the ticketing agent offered no explanation to me or the other two passengers that were at the counter with the same issue. Tried to book for a later flight, and the agent said he would oblige, but gave me a boarding pass for the next day, again without offering any explanation as to why. As a result of this debacle, I wound up having to pay for a hotel room that I did not use, and I had to cancel a meeting scheduled the following morning.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My wife and I are in our mid-60s and have flown extensively both on national and international flights, but our experience over the past two days with United Airlines is the worst flying experience we have ever had from an airlines. First, our flight on Monday from Geneva to Newark was problematic and when we landed we received a cell phone apology and told that we could receive a \"token\" concrete apology if we went online (no thanks). At Newark our direct flight to Milwaukee was first delayed two hours due to the crew not yet arriving and then it was cancelled entirely. UA first told us that we would not be able to fly out until Wednesday evening, two days later than our schedule and they would not pay for any hotel accommodations! There was a United flight to Milwaukee within the next two hours but it was full. When we again asked about flights to other airports they told us we could fly to Minneapolis, stay overnight at our own expense, and then fly to Chicago on Tuesday and then from Chicago to Milwaukee later that day. When we asked UA to pay for a Minneapolis hotel (they cancelled the flight!) the UA rep said that the cancellation was due to an \"air traffic control situation\" so UA wasn\\'t going to do squat for us. We took the Minneapolis flight and the UA rep said our luggage would be put on that plane but when we arrived in Minneapolis the UA rep there told us our luggage was sent to Milwaukee! So no change of clothes or toiletries, just what we had in our carry on. The UA baggage chief in Minneapolis was curt and dismissive, and couldn\\'t have cared less about us. We are now sitting in the Minneapolis Airport at 5 AM (and 4 hours of sleep in the hotel) after being in transit for 36 hours from Geneva, and can only wonder what is in store for us on the next two legs of our trip home. We have never experienced such poor service and no interest in customer care when foul ups occur on the airline\\'s side. Avoid United Airlines! Our expenses are certainly piling up due to UA\\'s actions (and non actions).', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Cody via Denver. Once again united has stranded thousands of people in Denver. They have no backup plan, no rooms available, no new flights to get you home, can't find your luggage. Last time I ever consider this want to be airline line for anything. Happens every time I fly them. I didn't book this flight so let it happen, and now I pay for room, rental car, meals, day late home and they really don't care about anybody in the 3 customer service lines that are hundreds of yards long. Beware the difference between them and any other airline. Fly at your own risk and take a lot of extra money.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Greenville. I called and asked United customer rep if the aircraft I was flying had a TV screen and they said yes. I am sitting on this aircraft right now as i right this review. no screen!

This is the second time united rep has given me false information about entertainment on aircraft. This will be the last time I fly with United to SC.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London to Chicago. Entertainment system didn\\'t work, at all.

I had a confirmed seat in row 32 with the rest of my family (With a paper to prove it) but this ridiculous airline changed my seat to row 12 with strangers and my family got to stay back.

I will never fly this airline again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Bangkok to Seattle via San Francisco. Booked an ANA operated UA ticket from Bangkok to Tokyo, with inward connection on UA to Seattle via San Fran. The Bangkok check-in agent failed to tag my second bag so it did not arrive in Seattle. I notified UA baggage services in Seattle and was told (very rudely) that because I didnâ€™t have the claim ticket it wasnâ€™t their fault but they would help anyway, which consisted of the agent logging my lost baggage in their â€œsystemâ€\\x9d and washing their hands of it. The baggage agent in Seattle was shockingly rude and uncaring. Figuring that was the last I would hear from UA on this matter, I phoned ANAâ€™s US reservation number and found someone who immediately took it upon herself to find a supervisor who called the Bangkok station manager. They found my bag and routed it to SeaTac airport on the next flight. Iâ€™m here picking up my bag, yet the UA bag tracking website and call center are still assuring me that, while My bag has not been found, they are attempting to locate it. I also just spoke to the same rude UA baggage agent, who rudely assured me again they are doing everything they can to locate my bag. What startling incompetence - itâ€™s a wonder UA can keep the airplanes serviced and in the air. Thanks for nothing, United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Seattle. Dreadful experience. Was booked on a 1615 flight to Seattle. The flight was cancelled on account of bad weather. United automatically rebooked me on the 1850 flight. The 1850 was delayed until 2305 on account of a late incoming aircraft. Understandable due to the bad weather but communication by United was bad. Departure time kept changing. I tracked the incoming flight and it showed 2138 arrival yet United showed the departure time as 2045 hrs which was misleading. Asked if my bags would be loaded onto the later flight and was told yes. They sent a â€œmove messageâ€\\x9d to ensure my bags would make the later flight. Finally landed in Seattle 6.5 hours late and to add insult to injury, both my bags didnâ€™t make it. Hereâ€™s where the real problem began. United didnâ€™t call me even once. Their toll free number and websites gave no information. The only way I could get any information wAs by going to the airport to speak to an agent. Finally got my bags 48 hours after checking them in. Miserable, horrible experience which I would not care to ever repeat.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United Airlines from Newark to Tampa. The worst experience with an airline Iâ€™ve ever had. They do not allow disabled people to board first, nor if you have a child over 2. The seats have arm holders that do not lift up so with a small child who is scared or a person who is larger and needs more space, itâ€™s not an option. You have to pay for carry-ons and pay to pick your seat, in addition to your ticket. So awful. One agent even threatened to refuse a woman on the plan for the size of her purse. As a disabled woman traveling with a child, Iâ€™m extremely dissatisfied. There were several great agents before we got to our gate which is the only reason this rating is not 0.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flight delayed from Denver to Helena 2 times! From the time I left to go to the airport in Colorado Springs and fly with United to Helena I could have driven in almost the same amount of time. When I politely ask the employee at the gate desk when the flight to Helena left, he was very short and rude.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Columbia to Tokyo via Denver. I checked into my flight 1 hour prior to takeoff as I had multiple connecting flights, first one was domestic to Colorado. The airport is a small local regional airport that decided to schedule 3 flights within a 20 min period with 1 line of TSA agents checking people in. Needless to say, United airlines left 20+ passengers behind on a flight with 50 seats total. American Airlines also had 2 flights taking off within this period but delayed the flights to ensure that all their passengers made it onto their flights. My checked bag also left without me, and will be sitting unattended in Okinawa for at least 24 hours while Iâ€™m stuck here in the United States. Needless to say, I will never fly United Airlines again even if they offered free flights.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Not only was my flight delayed and I wasnâ€™t notified, but then when I got on the plane in Portland bound for Chicago, they told me I would need to gate check my bag and pick it up at my final destination in Omaha.

Not happy and I will avoid flying United in the future at all costs!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Columbus. Nickeled and dimed, even for a carry-on.

Apparently half their flights don't even include one single carry-on. How on earth is someone supposed to bring clothing??\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Dallas Ft Worth to Denver. The rudest crew and unfriendliest flying experience. I get it, that was an early flight.

My husband and I were not seated together I was in row 28 and he was in row 38 with 2 gentlemen of about 7 ft tall. They were father and son basketball players the son with ASU. My husband was bruised on his foot by the lack of room in the seats. The bathrooms were locked for the first hour while the inept crew attended a woman with a seizure probably due to the excessive heat in the cabin. Another woman threw up and there was no cart service for the first half of the trip. When I spoke to the crew about the heat that was so bad most people were spillled over into the aisle as the seats were suffocating. I was told to turn on my air vent which was fully open. Duh! We were instructed to only use the bathroom in our assigned cabin, once they were finally open. The access to the bathroom was obstructed by the stretched out legs of the 7 ft man who should never been moved to the last row where the seat room is mallet due to airline design and lack of reclining seats although the row in front reclines into thenpassengers face', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Panama. Most horrible airline iâ€™ve ever flown with. 20 minutes of storm means 12 hours of delay. They kept postponing the boarding time so you keep counting the hours down but then they keep adding them up. The resources or explanations are not given to any of the passengers, so we just get told to â€˜sit down and relaxâ€™ like sitting ducks. While we are all here missing our next transit flights, but they couldnt care less.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Flew Los Angeles to Milan via Newark. What a horrible experience with United Airlines. This so called company is great at taking your money but if there is one bit of an issue, then you have to speak with a supposed customer service that is in the Philippines and all they do is say \"sorry, so sorry you have a bad opinion of us\". We\\'ve been stuck without any clothes or hotel and they basically wash their hands and blame it on the airlines. I used them once before and spent over $15K with them and more of the same. It was my mistake to comeback for a second round of abuse with this so called company.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Our flight was delayed, then we boarded. After numerous announcements we would be leaving we were asked to reboard. Twice a flight attendant was rude, cart with water and snacks pushed away from me. We were offered a meal voucher which we never got because they took so long to distribute them and when I got close was told we were boarding. After everyone was seated and thought we were finally leaving we were told the plane needed 20 minutes to fuel. An hour later we were told there was another delay because commissary hadn't delivered yet. At that point passengers raised objections to the delay while flight attendants laughed at us. My wife and I were stunned at how unprofessional they handled the situation. We arrived 5.5 hours late in Houston.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | We did not leave Melbourne until 1.5 hours after the departure time. Both my Daughter and myself did not mind but were concerned about our connecting flight. We were well treated and looked after on the plane and the staff were exceptional in their service to everyone. On landing we ran through the airport and yes we did miss our connection. At 64 years old its not an experience I wish to have again and not a nice start to our holiday. But this is nothing compared to the ignorant, arrogant and rushed manner that we were treated to all the way back to Australia on the return flight by a crew that treated everyone as if we should sit back say nothing and dont dare interfere with their time. I am not exaggerating their response. Should be ashamed of themselves. Shocking!', 'united airlines Not Verified | Charlotte to Newark. I will never fly United again, been here since 4.30pm to check in for a 6.30pm flight and right now itâ€™s been delayed indefinitely until they can find a crew to come get us? Itâ€™s now close to 10pm and no word on when we will be leaving. I have been here for over 5 hours and counting for no reason regarding weather delays.

It left Seattle late and arrived late to Chicago. Connecting flight was cancelled. Teen traveling alone and she received very little help from United employees in finding new flight. New flight booked and then delayed twice as well. Gate assignment kept changing - very rough landing in Chicago as well. They refused to let her carry on her bag and when she finally arrived in Knoxville after a nightmare day of travel and United had lost her bag - left it in Chicago.

Worst nightmare ever, our flight at 7/16 was canceled at 9:30 am we were 10 standby so no flight that day. We setup for next day at 6:39 am and no advise that we had to go to another gate, we lost flight. Now we setup for 6:45 pm and we dont really know if we are going to meet our vacation deadline since we already missed the day. Some customer service are doing their job but some think their doing it free. They play with your pain and dont care about the customers, if they would call me about the canceled flight then everything would be different, we paid taxi 4 times already, food, aggravation, wasting our money in our vacation package all because United airlines irresponsible customer service that never told us that out original flight was canceled, this so aggravating. I hope no one has to suffer like we did and hope you get all this straighten.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | We were very disappointed in United Airlines! When we got to our gate at Salt Lake airport at 4pm there were travelers that had been waiting since 9am due to aircraft maintenance, (a hydraulic seal). It didn't delay our flight but put a bad taste in our mouth right from the beginning. The customer service on ground and in the air was just OK. After we boarded all the TV screens were flashing DirecTV propaganda. Saying to swipe your card now and then later saying it was $5.99 for flights under 2.5 hours and $7.99 for flights over 2.5 hours. But they offered a *very generous* discount of $2 each if you swipe the same card on 3 or more screens. They advertise that they have free wifi though! So we connected and downloaded their app with no problem. But after selecting a movie and pressing watch, it makes you enable airplane mode in case of a connection interruption. But after doing so and pressing watch again, it says it can't connect, the same thing happened on our return flight. Which I'm sure forces or tricks people into paying for the DirecTV, which was very glitchy and the sound quality was terrible. So I'm glad we didn't end up paying for that. We landed 10 minutes late and our connecting flight was on the other side of O'Hare and we had 15-20 minutes to get there. We got to the gate with 5 minutes to spare after running the whole way. On our return flight, there were tons of people in the gate room waiting because of another aircraft maintenance delay. This caused us to have to move gates which wasn't a huge deal but still annoying. Our flight was also delayed about 30 minutes. When we boarded the cabin it was very hot and stuffy and barely went away by the end of the flight. We were miserable the whole time. Needless to say their airplanes are not properly maintained and are way out of date, (they still had an ashtray in the bathroom). Compared to Delta, United couldn't be worse. Even Southwest and Frontier are better. 10 or 20 years ago all of this might not have even mattered. Can we say misappropriation of funds? In short, we will never be flying United Airlines ever again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I am a frequent flyer, but not with United, thank goodness. Top to bottom the worst customer service company I have ever experienced. I watched gate agents laugh while a senior citizen walked to a far gate location to find out his gate had been been changed. This company has a severe mean streak from flight attendants to gate agents to bag handlers. It is as though they hate their customers. I am forced to use them occasionally, but I have quit all of my overseas trips and 90% of my domestic. I cannot imagine any company that deals with customers that would even come close to being this bad.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cancun to Houston. Our flight home from Cancun with United has been nothing but disastrous. We\\'ve been in the airport for hours with no guarantee of an expected arrival time or gate. We\\'re definitely going to miss our connecting flight- and it looks like we \"may\" get home tomorrow. United staff have not been helpful or polite. Do not fly United, it\\'s not worth saving the extra buck. I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Chicago. Do not fly United! There are other airlines more committed to their customer service, value and accommodations with similar prices. Disappointment after disappointment. Long story short things change and I ended up needing to change the time of my flight. Their policy is a 200 dollar change fee which was just as much as the ticket. I even purchased the misleading insurance just in case this might happen and they ONLY cover it if the airline changes or cancels... useless. Other airlines including southwest and jet blue have change fees as low as 60 and some free! So apparently they have a better handle on how to accommodate their flyers. Then I get to the airport and your only allowed one personal shoulder bag or purse, no carry on. I had the tiniest purse and had to check my 15 pound carry on. I didnâ€™t know Airlines donâ€™t allow carry ons these days. (I purchased the basic ticket which was not that much cheaper than other airlines. Had I known this I would have paid more for the ticket with another airline and wouldnâ€™t have to pay for a checked bag)I did not plan to check it and was supposed to change clothes for my destination to fit my busy schedule so was unable to do so. Much less value than other airlines with similar prices. No commitment to the customer experience, old unaccommodating policies and less value. I will absolutely not be flying United again since there is no reason to when I have multiple better choices.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I will never fly United again.

I used to travel all of the time using any of the major airlines. I have gone through a lot in the last 5 years. Travel has been very scarce. I booked a 2 week trip overseas. My mistake was to let the touring company book the air for me and my second mistake was letting them choose United. They gave only a 45 minute wait between my 2nd and 3rd flight and the plane left over an hour late. Strike 1. My final flight of the day was with Lufthansa. Fortunately Lufthansa got me on another flight but I had to wait 7 hours in an airport. Thank you Lufthansa. Strike 2 United. Coming home from my trip the touring company booked me a 5 hour layover in San Francisco. I already had 24 hours of real traveling time scheduled. After 3 different gate changes in San Francisco they finally said they were having plane maintenance issues. An 8:00 pm flight has now been moved to 10:20 pm at yet another gate. The time I'm leaving this flight is later than my scheduled arrival! United Airlines cannot be trusted to take their passengers to their desired destination in a timely manner. For domestic flights I will now go with Southwest and for international I will go with Delta or Lufthansa.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Frankfurt to Miami. I checked in at the Nice, France airport with Lufthansa and received my three boarding passes. I didn\\'t have to go through security at Frankfurt and after visiting the Lufthansa Star Alliance Lounge I walked to the boarding area. When I showed my boarding pass I was told that I needed to go to Document Check. I then got back in line and there was another problem so I went to the counter. I was told to go back to the end of the line and try again. I\\'m Group 1 so I wasn\\'t happy about that. The third try I still could not get in through the gate. I was told that because I had an exit row seat I had to go through a different entrance. Good Grief. United is the only airline that I know of that seats 10 across in Premium Economy on a 777-300. The seats are tight with a 17 inch width. About 35 minutes after take-off, they turned the fasten seatbelt sign off. First came a bag of bread sticks, then came a small bottle of water, then came my food with plastic tableware and then the beverage cart with a complementary glass of wine or a beer. There was no hot or moist towel. After all food items were picked up, they came by with another glass of wine or beverage. The fasten seatbelt sign came on several times during the flight because of a very light chop. United has changed the recorded announcement to \"Please fasten your seatbelt.\" The German speaking flight attendant had a very loud voice which would have made sleeping difficult, but in the economy cabin, they never turned off the lights or asked people to close their window shades so it was impossible for me to sleep. Prepare for landing, which means the fasten seatbelt sign is on and seats need to be upright was 50 minutes before landing, which makes for a long 50 minutes. When flying to Europe, I would recommend Lufthansa. On my flight a month earlier to Europe, Lufthansa turned off the fasten seatbelt sign seven minutes after take-off and it wasn\\'t turned back on until 25 minutes to landing, a very quiet flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Houston to Ft Lauderdale. I do not usually write reviews on anything unless it stands out to me. This airline was the worst flying experience of my life.

Donâ€™t fly United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Atlanta to San Francisco. One of the most inconsiderate customer service experiences that Iâ€™ve ever had before with United Airlines! My family and I booked a one way flight from Atlanta to Reno, NV where we were catching a connecting flight in San Francisco on 7/10/18. After boarding the flight in Atlanta at 7:35a, we sat in our designated seats for nearly an hour due to mechanical difficulties that they were having with the plane. When nearing San Francisco, the pilot and his flight attendants informed us that we were behind schedule by 25 minutes but he had informed the supervisor of our late arrival due to multiple passengers with tight connecting flights that were boarding while we were still in flight. Our flight landed at 10:17am. Due to the pilot landing at the wrong gate, we sat on the plane an additional 10 minutes before they finally allowed us to exit which was approximately 10:25a. Our connecting flight also with United Airlines allowed passengers to board between 10:15a and stopped boarding at 10:25a. Again, we were under the impression that our flight was being held for us. Upon approaching the gate, the 2 people at the gate and customer service desk were the absolute rudest and the most inconsiderate. They stated that they never got word from the pilot about our late arrival. They attempted to split my family (my husband, myself, and our 7yo son) apart to catch different flights then recanted and stated that they were full. Our son is competing in the USA National Karate Competition in Reno, NV and had to be checked in by 4pm. We explained that to them. Still no remorse or apology or anything. Instead, they attempted to book us for a 9:30p flight which we refused. The only thing left for us to do as parents was to rent a car and tackle the 4hr drive! Of course the rental was over priced because it was last minute and being dropped off in a different state! This whole experience was absolutely horrible!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My last experience with UA was just utterly gross. I sat in economy on the way from Chicago to Maui (9 hour flight) with no inflight entertainment, they do offer WiFi that you have to pay 35 bucks for if you want to use your computer and they offer a movie streaming service which you can use in your own personal device (you canâ€™t use this on your phone unless you have the United airlines app which you can download but youâ€™d have to do it before your flight because on the flight you have to pay the internet in order to download it from the App Store. For your computer, you have to install certain softwares in order to stream them from your laptop. They offer food that they charge you for because itâ€™s the passengers responsibility if they get hungry on a 9 hour flight apparently. The seat was tiny with the smallest amount of leg room you can imagine. Luckily I sat in the aisle seat so I was able to stretch my legs out into the aisle from time to time but if I kept my legs out for to long: a flight attendant would walk by having no promo em stepping on you or â€œinadvertentlyâ€\\x9d kicking you as they walk through without any contrition. The flight attendant (I dread calling them that because they seldomly attended) would make her way down the aisle with a tray of coffee or tea, run out by the time she got to row 10 and never attend to the people passed that point. Finally when she did make it to me with her cart (which was 15 minutes before landing) I asked if I could get a coffee and cranberry juice and she snarled at me with the response â€œok I really have to keep it movingâ€\\x9d. Overhead compartments was so small and people were playing a really tricky game of Tetris to make their stuff fit in. The electrical outlet was humongous so my charger for phone and computer kept falling out and the only way I could charge is if I physically held the charger in the outlet. The food that I ended up paying for was gross and cold and the bread was stale and difficult to chew. They put up a sheer curtain between first class and economy so that youâ€™re teased by the huge personal TVs and vast space they have. Clearly a ploy so that you only buy first class tickets since the alternative is physically painful. The bathrooms had toilet paper all over the floor (clearly no one tends to them during the flight). The call lights I would press for the flight â€œattendantâ€\\x9d were just promptly turned off without anyone swinging by to see if there was anything that I needed. Honestly, so many more issues to list, it was mortifying flying with UA and I really do not know how they are still in business when you compare thEm to other American airlines', 'united airlines Not Verified | Absolutely horrible experience flying United from San Antonio to Cancun! I understand that things happen but United seriously dropped the ball today. Every flight was over and hour late, over booked and hot! Worst customer service when trying to get a new flight due to a 108 minute delay on our first flight causing us to miss our connecting flight. I was hung up on when trying to get a new connecting flight. Overall nothing has been pleasant about this trip. Unacceptable for how much money we passengers pay. If we can punctual for the flight so should the airline!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Ft Lauderdale. Iâ€™ve used United Airlines a lot this year (even flew from Florida to Hong Kong with them) and it has let me down every time. It has by far, the worst customer service. The staff is rude, super unhelpful and definitely not prepared. Absolutely every flight Iâ€™ve tried United has been delayed and Iâ€™ve had lost my connections. They never give updates on any information and when you ask for some they simply answer â€œthey donâ€™t knowâ€\\x9d. They do not care enough to help you fix things they just treat you like trash and relocate you, making it worse. Super awful experiences. I do not recommend United Airlines to anyone.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Manchester to Houston via Newark. Never in my life have I had a worse experience with an airline. My two flights from Houston to Manchester were both delayed by three hours, but that's not even the worst of it! My flight back from Manchester was delayed over 5 hours! It was so bad that I missed my connecting flight to Houston and had to wait an entire day for a returning flight. And just when I thought I might finally be able to go home, that flight was delayed three hours too. When we finally got on the plane it took another hour to actually take off! I missed all my plans for the day at home because I was waiting 29 hours for a returning flight, and I now hate United Airlines with a flaming passion. Whatever you do, never ever fly with United Airlines, it is a massive waste of precious time and money and the awful service is nowhere near worth it.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | My flight from Hong Kong to Newark then Dallas. However, on July 3 the storm would not let this plane landed, they had to fly to Boston instead. Although I had some difficulties but United did take care of me although they had many people to care for. They first gave $20 meal voucher, then after a few hours they could not find new plane, they booked me to a hotel and booked me through American Airline to fly me back from Boston to Dallas the next day. This is the first time I experienced this problem, but they did take care of us. I want to say thank you.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Orlando. My overall experience was absolutely terrible, my inbound flight got delayed four times and a total of 3 hours. When I finally got to my destination and asked for help at customer service they said they couldnâ€™t help me, not to mention that I had to wait two hours to get my suitcase worst start to my vacation ever! Wait but itâ€™s not over getting home my flight ended up taking off late but I wasnâ€™t surprised at all! Then getting to the airport my suitcase was put on the wrong airplane and I had to wait a hour and a half again. Overall experience was terrible and unless I can feel valued right about now I will never be riding with United and will recommend to anyone not to take that airline either.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew roundtrip Chattanooga to Portland, ME I have not flown for several years, so prepared for challenges. Well, kudos to TSA recheck. Made security one big breeze. The plane in both directions were very small and had no overheads to accommodate the regulation size carryons which was included in my fare. Flying Economy Plus? Not sure, they have so many different levels depending on what a la cartes you picked! First the ticket agent in Chattanooga made me check my carry on and pay $25. When got to gate the same agent gave everyone in boarding area baggage tags to check them for free on the jetway! Did file complaint with United and they have responded to my issue with a refund, so one plus for them. But, the agent, hopefully, will be reprimanded. It was dishonest to charge me and I did not realize till I boarded plane. Return flight, we got in early. They did not have bags in jetway as we deplaned! Instead, we waited 45 minutes after 11 PM for bags to enter carousel in baggage claim. Very exhausting that time of night. Why did they not make it convenient for us to grab as we got off plane? Overall, flying pinched inside a tiny seat with little leg room was awful. the plane was 57 degrees on return flight and stewardess said they were working on - did finally begin to warm after 2 hours, just before landing. Did not partake of the free drinks and pretzels, so can't speak to snacks, seem crazy in short legs of flight. Would not look forward to flying again and booking online. Too many options you can pick from that just keep adding up and seem annoyingly presented on entire page to get you to spend more. Used to fly a lot, and will not miss it if never go again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United's flight from Denver, 1.5 hours late. Missed airport pickup, had to pay for another ride $28. Pilot said we were waiting for mechanics to come to tighten some bolts (I do not know if he was speaking seriously). Food on board not as described on menu: hamburger had no lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles as promised. As small as it was and served bare it was just like a 99c white castle hamburger. Seats comfortable and cabin crew kind and gentle. Agent at PSP kept trying to get money from me: first he claimed I'd have to remove 3 lbs b/c suitcase was 73 lbs. He had another bag on the scale. After removing it he said I was 1lb over and I said that 23 kilos is 51 lbs. He didn't care. Then insisted I pay $25 to check a suitcase even though was making an international connexion to one of their partners, but the swarthy 20-year old doesn't know what qualifies as a connexion. I couldn't convince him or his supervisor and they refused to call a ticketing expert. I was firm and insistent but because this supervisor told me I was rude (limited vocabulary), I paid the fine. I am constantly baffled that people who hate coming into contact with the public and who have no talent for customer service seem to be hired by United again and again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Our group was returning to the US after two weeks of international travel. At the United terminal we endured an overbooked check-in with rude ground agents. Some of our group waited for seat assignments until the plane was almost fully loaded despite the tickets being purchased a year in advance. The inflight service was just as rude as what we experienced in the terminal. Air New Zealand (the service we used in Australia and New Zealand) by comparison was staffed with a pleasant, polite and accommodating in flight crew. United needs to revisit customer service training of their entire staff. Improvement is sorely needed. Very disappointed and dissatisfied!', \"united airlines Not Verified | Norfolk to San Diego. Worst experience I've ever had flying. Every gate they told me to go to was wrong. I had no forewarning over the PA or on the website, flight gets delayed.

I've never had an experience this displeasing flying across the country.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Palm Springs to New York via San Francisco. You always know discourtesy is coming when the airport clerks refuse to wear their name plates. Charged me $25 for suitcase even though am making an international connexion. Agents don\\'t know LGA and JFK are \"co-terminals\" in NYC and that an Intl connexion in North America is 12 hours. Although I was the only customer there they refused to call their international desk but instead called me \"rude\" because I was firm. I just paid the fine because I know the next step after they call you rude is to call a SWAT team to arrest you. This is usual customer service in 2018. They just want money and they want a lot of it.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | First time flying with United and last time.

This is the worst airline I have ever flown. Every time I have flown United there has been delays. The weather is perfect both in my departing city and arriving city. There are no mechanical problems with the plane, but now we are sitting in the runway delayed for 1 hour. They give no explanation for the delay and no compensation Is provided. I am on a very small plane with only 3 seats in a row and no room for overhead storage. This airline should be ashamed.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Chicago via Los Angeles. On a business trip. Aircraft were relatively old and nothing special about the crew or the flights. The problem occurred when was flying from ORD to NYC LaGuardia LGA flight was supposed to leave at 5pm suddenly flight got cancelled without further information except due to weather conditions. The 4pm flight is going ahead and the 6pm flight as well. To my surprise the 3pm, 5pm and 7pm flights are cancelled to NYC however the 4pm, 6pm and 8pm flights are normal operation. Then the chaos started tried to rebook myself on a standby for the 6pm flight didnâ€™t work out checked with the United staff and they are probably deaf or not listening or helping not knowing where my luggage are or how to locate them or where to go. No one from the ground staff is helping and all they say itâ€™s due to weather we canâ€™t help you and thereâ€™s no further flights to NYC till tomorrow afternoon while I have to attend an important meeting at 8:30AM. This situation was just a joke. Eventually located my luggage which already been sent to LGA on the 6pm flight which I donâ€™t understand how would they send luggage without the passenger being on board the flight and had to queue with my colleague for almost 2 hours to rebook ourselves. When we reached the counter the only option the clerk gave us was to rebook to Hartford which is 2 hrs away from NYC we had to accept that and sort ourselves from Hartford then that particular flight got delayed which makes it arrive in Hartford at 3am which impossible for us to find our way to NYC. Eventually we booked ourselves on a different airline and paid 500 USD each for a one way ticket from Chicago to New York City. Seriously the most unorganised airline in the world. Later on we discovered that they had a system failure and thatâ€™s why they couldnâ€™t operate certain flights but to avoid compensating passengers or booking hotels for them they delcraed itâ€™s due to weather. Will never fly with this airline ever again. Itâ€™s the first and last experience with them.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This is the worst airline, I thought it was Spirit but no its United Airlines. I flew basic economy and they give you nothing. If you do not pay for a bag you get treat like a third class citizen. I was not allowed to check in online I had to go to the airport to check in and then see an agent so she could check my bag to make sure it wasn't too large to fit in the small box. I asked for assistance, the agent was very rude, she never came to help I had to figure things out myself and then on top of that I still didnt even get an assigned seat. After checking in you have to go to the to the gate and let the agent give you a seat after everyone else is assigned, this is only one step above standby. Everyone was scattered throughout the plane and no one was sitting with their family, people had to switch seats on their own. I paid for a checked bag for my wife and her bag never made it into the plane. We were told that they would have to deliver it. We arrive oh are at 7.30am and the bag wouldn't be delivered until after 2.30pm. We had to contact her doctor to call in her prescription to the pharmacy because it was in her bag.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United Airlines from Nashville to Alaska via Denver.

This is why I fly American.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Buffalo to Chicago. Terrible is not even close to how bad this airline is. To begin, my flight here was delayed a full hour. Now my flight was cancelled last minute and after trying to contact the company they said our only option was to travel back home 2 days after our scheduled date. We asked about stand by and they said there was no way we could do stand by because the flights were completely booked. First of all that's a lie. Then they said they'd be able to get us on separate flights one at 11am and the other at 550 the next day. So we accepted since it's better than waiting 2 days. we decided to go to the airport an hour after talking on the phone since we weren't near the airport at that time and the man on the counter said we were able to get on a flight that same night which was the flight after the one we were scheduled to get on but since the other lady had already booked our separate flights it was no longer an option. So already beyond annoyed at this point. My friend then goes to the airport at 8am the next day for his 11am flight and they tell him that there's plenty available space on the 830am flight! How was this not mentioned the day before. He barely made it to the 830am flight and then I decided to head to the airport straight after to see if I can get on the next flight home. They finally allowed me to do standby but 2 flights later still no space according to them. I am missing work and important meetings because employees don't care about their customers. I will never fly United again.\", \"united airlines Not Verified | So disappointed! Actually the cabin staff were great, but there is no support of the company if the flight got delayed and you end up losing your transfer! I am now in Washington airport and I need to wait for one day, my flight in Beijing delayed for 2 hours, and consequently I lost my flight to Brazil, the company gave me no help, no place to stay overnight, only gave me a coupon that I could call a number so I could get discount for a hotel. I called the number and there was no available room, they gave me two choices: or you call the number and stay in a hotel or you spend the night inside the airport. Which kind of airline company does that? I unfortunately wouldn't recommend this airline due to this issues.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | An absolute nightmare. I am a 1k premier member only due to business travel. United has the absolute worst customer care in the industry. A result of grossly deficient leadership in the corporate office, where accountability is a foreign concept. I feel for those United employees that truly do care and try to help customers. I fly approximately 25 flights a year with United. 70% are delayed or I experience an issue. I dream of the day when I no longer have to board another United flight. It is very sad to see what United has done to a once proud and enjoyable carrier called Continental. I have attached a picture of the customer care counter where four agents were available despite 13 kiosks.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Newark. Worst airline. We booked basic economy on orbitz and we did not know this had no carry on and we had a 6 month old baby. They made us feel terrible because we asked to take one carry on which had the baby stuff. My husband and I had to sit in different area on the airplane even though we have a baby and they were very rude to us. Never ever will fly this airline.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Tokyo to Washington. Poor value. We paid over $10,000 for round trip from Louisville to Ho Chi Minh.

I was not pleased by all this lateness.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Kansas to Frankfurt via Chicago, connecting to Cairo. My wife broke her hip in Jerusalem requiring a hospital stay and an immediate return to Kansas as well as a cancelling of vacation stopovers in Athens and Germany. United charged us an additional $9500 which was approximately the same as what we prepaid for both of our First Class tickets. They would not bargain, at all. As my wife was in great pain and an immediate return to the US was needed I had no choice. I contacted United upon my return to no avail. United is now my last choice for flying overseas. We are returning to Europe soon and have friends there. We always will fly First Class, just not with United.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via San Francisco. It was a rough trip flying back home to Pittsburgh. My family and I woke up bright and early at 4am to avoid LA traffic. Our flight was originally around 6-7am but then I was notified of a delay. Because we had a layover, we would not make our second flight home. I had to change my flight last minute which was fine because we were only maybe an hour behind schedule. My family and I were finally on our first flight and I was getting ready to sleep for the next 5 hours before landing in DC. I believe it was the autopilot who came on to talk about how they were having issues with the plane but he assured us that they are working on it. First they had the maintenance people come, then there was something about paperwork needing to be signed and finally, the autopilot mentioned that the gas was in the wrong area or chamber. I've sat on this plane for maybe an hour and half and now I'm rushing to call customer service to get me on the next flight ASAP because the flight was cancelled. Apparantly, the next two flight to SF was booked but my family of 3 can be waitlisted in case someone canceled. Did I mention that one man was absolutely going nuts when we all got off the plane? He mentioned something about his brother is on life support. There was also a huge line of people waiting to be waitlisted. However, I manage to book a flight for 12:58pm. At this point, my family and I have been at the airport for 7 hours. Finally, we get on the 12:58pm plane and we land in DC on time for our flight to Pittsburgh. It was storming on and off while on the first plane with plenty of turbulance. We were also delayed on the second flight! I thought they were going cancel our flight due to weather but they didn't and we did manage to get to Pittsburgh around 11-12pm. United Airline actually gave my family $300 for our next flight but the chances of us flying ever again is slim. This whole trip was an absolute nightmare with the delays and cancellation. On top of that, sitting in economy class is the most uncomfortable place to be. Honestly, take some advice from people who make genuinely comfortable lounge chairs with cushions in it please. There was absolutely no support at all and no room on the plane. The only good thing about the flights was that I was given free apple juice. I will never fly again if I can avoid it.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to ReykjavÃ\\xadk. This is so far the worst airline from my experience.

I have decided not to fly through united irrespective of the cost.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Los Angeles to Melbourne. United just don\\'t get it despite what their competition is doing. I\\'ve just paid over $8,000 for a business class ticket return Melbourne Los Angeles and get asked to pay for \"premium\" scotch in their new lounge. We\\'re not talking about top shelf scotch either - try standard 10 yr Glenfiddich at about $50/bottle. For free one can have some bottom of the rung local bourbon. United don\\'t seem to function with anything other than a penny wise, pound foolish philosophy. I am looking forward to booking with Virgin Australia or Qantas for my next similar flight. On the flight over I was underwhelmed by the cramped business class capsule. The seat was comfortable but I\\'m slim. And I felt that I just fitted into the seat width. Service was non existent. Had to ring the service buzzer twice for water. Never handed out bottles when lights go out like other airlines. Neither did they go around asking selfish passengers to close their window blind when most were trying to sleep with daylight outside. On a 14 hr flight this is detrimental to all the other passengers wellbeing as it made it hard to sleep. There is basically no storage in the capsule in front of one, or to the side. The limited storage is behind and to the side, right where all the cables for headphones and chargers sit. Their business class cabin looks cheap. It is serviced like a cheap budget airline. But they know how to charge like a premier airline. They can\\'t even offer a business class passenger before departing on a 15 hour flight a free scotch. Except you can have a very cheap bourbon. Cheap seems to be their mantra.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I was scheduled to fly from Washington DC (IAD) to Newark (EWR) with United Airlines and then continue via SAS from EWR to Copenhagen. Due to weather issues in the greater NY area the United flight was delayed by 6 hours and my connecting flight had left when I arrived at EWR. At IAD I had explained to United agents that my luggage was checked in all the way to Copenhagen, and that I needed guidance regarding if/how/where I needed to pick up my luggage when arriving in EWR. I was simply told to explain my situation to United agents when arriving at EWR. Following guidance from the United flight crew I stood in line for two hours to speak to a United agent at the United EWR customer care booth located next to my arrival gate. When I finally talked to an agent I was asked to go to the United baggage claim booth. After having waited another hour the United baggage claim agent informed me that she had located the luggage, but that I had to wait at least another 5 hours for my bag to be brought to the United baggage claim area. I was then told to show up 8.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage (*note that after arriving at EWR Scandinavian Airlines had manage to re-book me via American Airlines to go to Miami and then via a SAS flight to Copenhagen). By the time United told me to leave without my luggage it was 12.30 AM in the night â€“ 12.5 hours after departing IAD airport. I was offered no hotel options. After having spent 35 min a cab to reach a friendâ€™s apartment in NYC I spent another 30 min in a cab ($150 out of pocket) and returned to EWR 7.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage. A third United agent then told me that they could not locate my luggage in their system and that it likely was with SAS. I was then told that since the SAS office only opens 9 AM the right thing would have been to wait the five hours the previous night. This conversation took 30 secs and it was made very clear that this was not United problem and that I was advised to board my American Airlines flight without my luggage and file a lost luggage complaint with SAS upon arriving in Copenhagen, which I then did. I arrived in Copenhagen 8 am and had to continue straight to my air-bnb and then to the university. At this point I had slept 2-3 hours since my departure at Dulles on the 19th (2 days ago) and I had no new clothes to change into. Upon returning to IAD from Copenhagen on June 24th I still had not received my luggage. After being passed from one United agent to another at IAD I was told that my luggage was at EWR. I filed a lost luggage complaint with United and since received around 10 text messages saying that my luggage was not located. Early morning 12.39 AM on June 27th, while asleep, I get a text by a private company contracted by United stating that they are â€œattempting to deliver my luggageâ€\\x9d and I am asked to call/text to confirm my address. 6.02 AM I write back to confirm my address and I text the private agent to call me before dropping off my luggage. I leave my apartment 6.40 AM only to discover that the private agent had left my luggage outside my building without notifying me.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Frankfurt. United Airlines continues to disappoint, which is why I have not flown them on an International flight for 4+ years. Was attracted by the \"hype\" of the new Polaris service, but it is much-ado-about-nothing. IAH President\\'s Club is a joke. The beer & wine selection is limited to 1 or 2, or they want to charge $9 for a drink - nice touch after you have paid $5,000+ for a ticket. Food offerings consisted of some trail mix, some cold veggies & some soup. How United believe they can compete with this type of inferior International service is lost on me. No United Execs have apparently never flown on the International competition, or they would be embarrassed to hype Polaris. Flight attendant came around 1 time during the 1st hour of the flight - once. I had a glass of red wine, but when she returned for her 2nd visit, she announced they had already ran out of red wine for the remainder of the flight. This fairly well sums up the entire United approach to their International business class product. Won\\'t fly them for another 4 years.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Houston. Yet another dumpy old United plane. Further underscores why I never fly United for my International trips, and rarely fly them domestically. The only consistency with UAL is their continuing ability to disappoint. Both in equipment and service delivery. Even if you have a 1st class ticket it does not gain you entry to the UA Club Lounge, but that is no big loss, since UA's lounges are below mediocre at best. United, like American and Delta, are the best sales promotion tools that International airlines have.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Frankfurt. Seats are much too narrow - youâ€™ve got to hug yourself in order to leave your neighbor alone. My girlfriends entertainment system kept crashing. Everything seemed to be outdated and a bit dirty.

We arrived at the Tucson airport about an hour and a half early and while we were heading to our gate we received a push notification that the flight was delayed so we went and grabbed food, and set up at a charging station a few gates down. When it was getting close to the time that we would need to start boarding, we walked over to the gate and found out that the flight left at its scheduled time. No updates, no announcement for boarding, nothing. The woman at the gate laughed it off saying that when the pilot wants to leave the pilot leaves. With no more flights leaving from Tucson that day on United, we were infuriated. The woman was not empathetic, wouldnâ€™t look us in the eyes, and gave us no other options but to stay in Tucson (not comped by United, mind you) and arrive to Cleveland at 3pm the next day. We called the customer service line and the representative literally said â€œI donâ€™t understand why you werenâ€™t at your gate, you should have been thereâ€\\x9d. After he also unempathetically didnâ€™t even try to help us, I asked to speak to a manager. Iâ€™m pretty sure I spoke to the same guy who just changed his voice into a higher pitched tone. He said the same and wouldnâ€™t even give me a refund, gave me a hard time about missing the flight and said that he knows that they make courtesy announcements before taking off. Apparently you donâ€™t, or I wouldnâ€™t have been stranded in Tucson. After finally calling again and speaking to a much nicer woman, we were able to get a partial refund and bought tickets on American Airlines flying just a few hours later. Iâ€™ve never had such a poor customer service experience in my life and will never fly with United again unless absolutely necessary. Taking my business elsewhere!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Absolutely terrible service and we will never be flying with you guys ever again. We called the night before to make sure everything was okay with the flight and it was. However, when we get to the airport which is 2 hours away from where we live we get a call once we are at the airport that the flight was cancelled. So, we think that we will just be getting on another flight so we will still be able to get to our destination that day. We stood in line to check in for about 35 minutes and then the person there, after failing to put in our confrontation code 3 times, told us that our flight has been rescheduled for tomorrow and that we might not even be able to get on that flight. Iâ€™m really disappointed in United Airlines in their lack of communication. We werenâ€™t even told why the flight was canceled. They wasted our time and lost our business. Not that they truly care but my motherâ€™s family who were suppose to pick her up took the day off work and my mother, who hasnâ€™t seen her family for many years now, is forced to go back home and wait because United Airlines canâ€™t get their priorityâ€™s straight. Your customers should be your main priority and clearly they arenâ€™t.', \"united airlines Not Verified | MBS Airport to Reno. Will never fly with United again. There were multiple maintenance issues - 2 on one layover at Denver, and 1 in chicago. The Chicago flight we ended up turning around due to hydraulics issues which caused us to miss our connecting flight. There were no agents at the gate to help us find a new flight so we had to call. The first time we called they hung up on us. All in all we were almost 7 hours late to our destination. I'm guessing they aren't using great planes if they had that many issues and awful customer service. Will not recommend to anyone.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Phoenix. Due to a mechanical issue the airplane was delayed and we sat on the plane for 30-45 minutes. While I would have preferred an ontime arrival, delays can happen. The crew was very professional and served snacks and water and informed us continuously and the doors were reopened just in case somebody wanted to leave the aircraft. United proactively rebooked me on a later flight just in case the issue would not have been fixed. In the end we did depart with a delay. The rest of the flight was uneventful. I was flying Economy Plus and the seat was comfortable and offered enough legspace. United Economy Plus is the same seat and same onboard service as it is in regular Economy but with some inches of more legspace. I just flew with a different us carrier in the Premium Economy Class/Comfort Plus class and they also offer a free alcoholic drink and a premium snack in the Economy Plus section. United should do the same thing and upgrade the Economy Plus section.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Absolutely horrible, will not be flying United again even if I have to pay more. Terrible customer service. My plane way delayed for 5 hours because they were waiting for another plane to arrive. This caused many of us to miss our connecting flights, and minimal information was given. They did nothing to make this situation better for their customers. No company should be able to treat paying customers like this.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Denver to Albuquerque. From now on I will always pay more to avoid this airline. Iâ€™ve flown twice in the last month with United and both times were absolute terrible experiences. Long delays with minimal information provided as to why. You canâ€™t bring a carry on if youâ€™re flying basic economy class but they donâ€™t have a good system for keeping track of baggage apparently because they managed to lose mine on a 45 minute direct flight. Pay extra to fly a different airline because this is trash.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Iâ€™m a small business owner, and if I treated my customers the way United Airlines treats their customers I would be out of business. I spent $2800 to fly my family to Turks and Caicos from Denver. United Airlines changed the aircraft and even though I booked our flights over a year ago, they separated our family all throughout the aircraft. Our children had to enter the aircraft on the back and we had to enter the aircraft on the front. This was on our way back home. When we connected through Houston I noticed that my luggage was damaged. So I have a three hour layover in Houston and I figured I would go and talk to baggage services, as I did not want to handle it when I arrive in Denver at 11:30 at night. I mean why not handle it at a normal time of day when I have three hours to kill, but the person working the United baggage service tells me she canâ€™t do a claim for me and it must be done at my final destination. When I asked why couldnâ€™t it just be handled right now she said that is United Airlines policy. Iâ€™m sorry, but when your policy causes agitation to a customer, and you have no explanation besides itâ€™s your policy then that is something that should be changed. I found it comical that United airlines employee tells me that I need to post on social media about how negative my experience was. I doubt that will do any good.

I typically do not think it is worthwhile. However, the treatment I received today was so incredibly rude I feel I need to share my experience. The woman working the front desk treated my husband and I with such disdain I honestly thought she was joking at first. The flight was uncomfortable, but that's to be somewhat expected in economy, so that part I was not as bothered by. Seriously, train your staff better. Literally every flight attendant, as well as the women at the front counter before boarding, were rude and just generally unpleased. Towards all passengers.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Austin to Reno via San Francisco. This is the worst airline. My plane was delayed 4 hours in San Francisco the was my only first stop I was going to have. The plane was so supposed to go at 9:40 which never happened they change our time to 10:30 then to 11:15 then to 12:30 we end up leaving from San Francisco at 2:00 in the morning. The worst thing the ever happened to me I was flying with my kids and my self of course my kids fell to sleep waiting in the airport when they started to call everyone to get ready to go in to the airplane I ask the lady in the front desk the I need it help to get my 3 year old and my 7 year old out of the chair weâ€™re they were sleeping, she went and ask her manager and the manager came and told me I canâ€™t help you,you going to have to wake them up. While we were in line one lady the was going to bord with us was checking the depart screen she said our fly was delayed by 4 hours and on the screen it says the this fly the leaves at 2:00 am itâ€™s on time ugh even worst we waited for more people so they could have there plane full so they wouldnâ€™t have to use 2 planes. The was my worst experience at United Airlines like I said I will never buy a ticket form United Airlines', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This has been a horrible experience! My flight got delayed 15 hours. Initially it was only delayed 2 hours then when everyone got on the plane we had to sit there for 2 more hours before they finally announced that the plane is broken. By that point it was 12:30 AM. Then we waited for a new plane, which arrived but the crew has left already so they delayed it until 11:00 AM until the next morning. They did not provide a hotel, did not provide an alternative earlier flight, and refused to give a refund.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | We arrived at 10 A.M. for a 12 am flight because thatâ€™s what you are told to do. We get to the airport only to find out itâ€™s delayed for a little over an hour. No big deal we can still make our connecting flight well of corse not they delayed it another 30 min. We miss our connecting flight they canâ€™t get us on another flor 4 hours. (9 hours) then that flight is delayed another hour. So 10 hours in airports to go to a place that would have taken me 8 hours to drive to. If I fly a discounted airline I expect this type of service because you get what you pay for but United although gives cut rate service their prices are not cut rate. Then I paid for upgraded seats but they said that didnâ€™t matter anymore. This is the fourth time in a row flying United and having major issues. I can care less about food, chairs or even the way the flight crew treats passengers but donâ€™t charge me to get to a destination that I could have driven to in a lot less time. I will be asking for some money back. Not a voucher either because I will never take united again unlesss I have a sudden urge to spend a whole day in the airport. Their employees in the Houston airport are not nice which is probably because they are tired of coming up with excuses for their employers lack of management or leadership. I canâ€™t even rate value for your money because they should pay me for my whole wasted day.', \"united airlines Not Verified | I have always thought that United is the worst, but for some unknown reason, I keep giving it another chance. I am currently sitting on a boarded plane that is delayed by six hours, and we have just been told that because of the massive delays, the crew can no longer fly us directly to Newark. We now will be going to San Fran in between. Oh and no one on board knows when we will actually take off. According to multiple flight attendants, there are no updates? So, we are stuck here on the plane with no options, no plan for leaving, and a required additional stop that was unplanned. United should take a hard look at airlines like EVA and Cathay, and learn a thing or two. It's shameful to pay for such abysmal service. Please do yourself a favor and choose any other airline.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Newark to Orange County. What a gross experience. The aisle was way too tiny to pass even for someone who is very petite making going to the filthy bathroom a chore. I had to go back to my seat in order for the snack cart to pass by. The economy plus really was a minus because we still didn\\'t have ample leg space. What happened to the barf bags (just in case someone got sick) and the blankets and pillows? I think that we were overcharged for baggage. The aircraft loads by groups. We were in group 2. A fellow and his daughter, who were in group 4, got on the group 2 line. When he got to the gate, the attendant told him that he was in the wrong group but she would let me board \"this time.\" He had 3 rolling cases plus a large backpack. The flight instructions specifically say \"only one rolling case allowed per person\". He was allowed to bring all 4 cases on the aircraft while people boarding in later groups had to check their carry on bag due to lack of room.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | The ground service is really bad. I was on the flight from Denver to San Francisco via United Airlines, and was going to connect to another international flight. However, the flight from DEN to SFO delayed an hour and half, which made me only 30 minutes to get to my connection. Right after I got off the plane, I asked the ground service to give me a delay certificate, and they told me they didnâ€™t have, and said that I should have asked when I was in DEN, but I was stuck on the plane for almost an hour, who can I ask for a delay certificate? The ground staff didnâ€™t do the job well. They were supposed to know the situation of the flight and assist the passengers. When a flight delayed for an hour and half, they should have prepared delay certificates or at least told the passengers where to get the certificates. In the end, I ran to catch my coming flight and made it, but my luggage didnâ€™t. It seems like United Airlines doesnâ€™t care about their passengers if they canâ€™t catch their connections.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington Dulles to Philadelphia. This flight was delayed almost 3 hours because it originated in Orlando and they could not take off due to severe weather. I must mention that the airport staff once we were notified of the delay immediately brought plenty of water and snacks to distribute to all of us that weâ€™re waiting and kept everyone informed with PA announcements and the gentleman at the desk was extremely patient answering every single question from all who came up to him. It really looks like United is trying to do the right thing. Once the aircraft arrived the flight lasted under an hour, we quickly boarded the aircraft and no time we had taken off and landed in Philadelphia. Kudos to United for a job well done!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London to Washington Dulles. My experience onboard was very pleasant. Usually on an international flight you get the better crew, everyone was very friendly, polite, and genuinely happy. The airplane looked and felt old, the screen to watch movies was a little bit larger than my iPhone X however the entertainment options were very good. On this 7.5 hour flight I was served one hot meal, one hot snack, a small snack, and unlimited beverages. One flight attendant was extremely nice to me and even brought me two ice creamâ€™s. I upgraded to economy plus for around $200 and the only thing you get is more leg room. The seat is the same as in the regular economy cabin and the service is the same. The Internet I thought was very expensive around $30 for the entire flight so I passed on that option however I would definitely fly United again. Good job United it looks like youâ€™re trying to fix your reputation!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Houston to St. Louis. This airline is terrible. They hit me with a last minute bag fee of $25 and I only had one bag. My return will include another $25. I had a very small bag but had large shampoo bottles in it so needed to check. Employees are rude. Plane was gross. Avoid United Airlines if possible.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Seattle. Bad experience through out the journey with United Airlines: We booked the tickets with the infant who is going to sit in my lap. His name was not included in the boarding pass and we had to suffer standing in the long waiting lines. It's just common sense that when you give us an option to online check in, and we use it that means we want to avoid standing in lines. Since we are travelling with an infant on lap, and the flight had to start with 1 hr delay and we were on the runway, we asked if they can help me with something to keep my baby's milk fresh, they gave us the airsick bag full of ice for which I was happy, but unfortunately the bag was not water proof (not plastic, it was paper bag). We did not knew this and all our other bags became wet as the ice melted. This is a 5 hr 41 min flight, which means passengers expect some food on the flight. The male attendant was not at all cooperative with me or any of the passengers around me. I don't understand why they have a menu with 5 or 6 pages with different types of food options.May be they are using the same menu across all their domestic and international flights to save money from printing different menu cards for different routes. All over we had a very bad experience with United airlines and definitely will not take the flights nor recommend to anyone.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Orange County. I will avoid flying United at all costs. Their customer service is terrible and you have to pay to check in a bag if you buy economy. Didnâ€™t even know that until I tried to check-in. They will find any way to nickel and dime you. I rather pay more and fly on another airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United Airlines at LAX literally the worst service Iâ€™ve ever received in my life and I have flown more than 3 dozen times. They forced me to check a small backpack for no reason other than I had a purse on me which they counted as another personal item. Many other people did this with much larger purses and carry on items. Complete and total garbage customer service at LAX. Will not fly United ever again even if itâ€™s cheaper, especially in Los Angeles.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London to Denver. After flying BA and AA on this route I can safely say United Airlines is the worst airline. Certainly not the friendly skies! Food was poor. Aircrew were by comparison unattractive. Basically, after looking forward to flying on the Dreamliner, the way united have configured the plane and the service ruined my experience. Although leg room was fine, the seat width is dire. Also insisting on dimming the windows after lunch on a daytime flight with a daytime arrival at the destination is just plain dumb. If you have a choice, fly AA. I won't be choosing United for my next flight at all costs.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sacramento to Port of Spain via Houston. Worst trip ever. This was a nearly 6 hour overnight flight to Trinidad. We paid for extra leg room and got an additional 2 inches. No food was offered except a small bag of pretzels or small packages of food for fee. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable and some genius designed them so the controls for the video screen are on the top of the arm rest where most people put their elbows. My neighbor unintentionally reset the video throughout the trip. The video flashes endless ads for paid streaming access while you\\'re trying to sleep. Even once I figured out how to turn it off my neighbor\\'s elbow would turn it back on again. Who thought this was a good design idea? Finally, no pillows are offered and the courtesy \"blanket\" more closely resembled an oversized tea towel than a blanket.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Columbia to Chicago. United Airlines cancelled my return flight from Chicago to Columbia without any notice due to \"operational difficulties.\" Ok, fine. Something occurred that may have been out of their control. Their response, however, was very poor in my opinion. I needed to change my flight into STL and rent a car to get to Columbia. This cost me an extra 170, plus gas. United didn\\'t care at all to compensate me for these costs. Very poor customer relations - left a bad taste in my mouth.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I booked a flight out of Savannah to Philly. The flight flew to Newark, and I was informed at the last minute that I would have to take an Amtrak train from Newark to Philly as the 1 hour train ride was apart of my flight. Then on my flight back they made me miss my original flight because I did not check in at the Amtrak station. They then put me on another flight that was that was delayed for maintenance issues. Overall worst airline experience ever.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This was the worst experience I have had on an airline. Our flight out of Aspen was delayed due to rain, which is normally for an Aspen Denver flight, however every person on the flight had tight connecting flights. The crew knowing many passengers needed to get off, would not open the door off the plane for 22 minutes. After majority of the passengers now need to run to the other side of Denver Terminal B (and for those who donâ€™t know thatâ€™s close to a mile) we are told our plane will be waiting for our bags to be put on before take off. They were not. Not even put on the next flight, they will be arriving two days after our arrival. United so kindly asked us to pay for their drop off as well. Aside from incompetence, the aircraft themselves have abominable service, we flew first class and were served Mac and cheese as adults.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I strongly caution against flying United Airlines. They do not care about their customers, their customer's time, nor their money. On May 21, 2018, the United Airlines flight was canceled for 4 passengers, in which my husband and I had purchased all four tickets. This was the worst travel experience that I have encountered. The customer service of United Airlines is at most, deplorable. To begin, the flight that was canceled on 5/21/18 from BNA to IAH was canceled due to weather conditions that were non-existent. The cancellation was only reported 3-4 hours before the flight was set to take off. This placed us in a compromising position as we had a connecting flight to Honolulu (HNL) from Houston (IAH), the only flight for this destination, for that day. We had to scramble to find a nearby flight from Hunstville, AL, which is two hours away from where we reside. We attempted to call a United Airlines representative to help us find seats for all four passengers, but we were unsuccessful. My husband and I were the only couple that could fly from Huntsville into Houston and then into HNL. The other couple was forced to fly from Huntsville, to Denver, to San Francisco, to Los Angeles, and then to Honolulu. The customer service that we received over the phone from the representative was atrocious. The representative was ignorant when giving information on the flights, she rudely retorted comments back that reflected her ignorance, and due to her procrastination our travel plans were further delayed. We had to drive to the HSV airport and leave our car in long term parking. All of these incidents incurred an extra expense, for which should be compensated for by United Airlines. All we received was a measly flight credit of $75.00 for my husband and I and we purchased four tickets!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | It has been more than three years since I have flown United Airlines. I stopped flying because of old planes, no in seat entertainment on long legs,poor service and surly flight attendants. Nothing has changed in these years. On my four hour leg (IAD to SEA) the entertainment system & wifi was down. Again, another United negative experience.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Shannon to Newark. Worst airline experience Iâ€™ve ever had. Flight was delayed because of mechanical problems and we were stuck for an hour and a half extra on the plane before departure. Then another hour after landing waiting on a gate on the other side of the airport and most everyone missed their connecting flights. Our connecting flight was then delayed again another hour and when we finally arrived, we were stuck in a foreign country without our luggage because it â€œdidnâ€™t make our flightâ€\\x9d. We had to call multiple times to get our luggage delivered. Will not fly again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Worst flight experience Iâ€™ve ever had. When I got to the airport to drop off my bag (after self check in) it took 25 minutes for them to put a sticker on my bag and put it on the belt and I was the first one in line. There were only 3 people working and very long lines and wait times. When I got to the gate to fly out I heard that I would miss my connecting flight I went to talk to gate agents to see what my options are. They were not very helpful the only thing they did was rebook my on a flight for the morning and told me Iâ€™d have to figure out my plans once I was in Houston. They were condescending and blaming everything on policy. When I got to Houston, the customer service agents there were very helpful in getting me a room and other accommodations. But when I went to receive my checked bag for the night in the hotel, I was told that I was unable to get the bag and couldnâ€™t have access to it til tomorrow. United is the worst airline I have flown, regarding everything from check in to reliability. At the Nashville airport there were 9 total delayed flights and 8 of them were United. Iâ€™ve also heard from several other guests that this is a common occurrence and had happened to them earlier this week. United needs some serious change in their operations as well as retraining employees.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I booked my flight along with my husbands flight 9 months in advance. The day before my flight I discovered I was only getting one boarding pass. My husbands flight booking was under a different conf #. This would be fine however the united miles plus card no longer applies to him, therefore he looses priority boarding AND United took it upon them selves to change our seating assignments to where we were no longer seated next to each other for 14 hr flights. I have never had my seating changed by any airline after choosing a seating assignment if they \"cant be guaranteed\" there is no advantage flying United over Southwest aside from paying more money. They had availability to accommodate to economy plus but of course wanted more money. we had to change flights adding a 4 hour layover and pickup arrangements just to sit next to each other. No wonder United ranks so poorly in customer service. I will avoid flying this airline at all costs in the future, its more important to try and suck another $300 out of a customer than accommodate and make it right. I will also be canceling my United Plus card as it serves no benefits. It does us no good to travel together if only one person on the card gets priority. I was on the phone for over an hour and 30 min with costumer service that is a joke. My time is money but obviously United does not care about that.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Birmingham. Every time I fly with United it is an awful experience. They have the most rude, arrogant, and unhelpful agents at the gate and on the plane. If you want a pleasant experience avoid United.', \"united airlines Not Verified | Las Vegas to Newark. So they waited until 30 minutes before boarding to tell us about a 3 hour delay. After this delay, they let us board. After letting everyone get boarded and situated, they announce another hour delay. Instead of waiting another hour to board, they packed us in like sardines and continued to delay the plane. I understand delays are our of their control, but tell us as you find out. Dont trick us into being stuck on the flight. Nothing was added for a 5 hour delay, 2 of which were spent on the plane, sitting still at the gate. We paid for a flight that leaves at 11:15am. So, if you can't accommodate me, let me know. Don't drag me along. Get better at organizing flights before you have a whole company that screws over thousands of people. Never flying United again.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | Los Cabos to Portland via San Francisco. Absolutely terrible service.

My original flight had been cancelled and I was informed that I may not be able to catch another flight for three days and that they would not be providing a hotel. I retrieved a ride and made it to my destination (13 hours later than I was supposed to be there) and proceeded to follow up with phone calls to ask where my baggage might be since the workers at the airport did not answer any of my questions.

Traveling to the Bay Area for a conference, I booked this flight on a 777-200, thinking it might be kind of fun to fly on a domestic widebody and that the cramped 3-4-3 configuration would be fine. How wrong I was. There was a half-hour delay prior to departure â€” annoying, but not a big deal. Once on board, however, I noticed that the TVs had been removed and replaced with personal device entertainment holders. However, we were informed that the Wi-Fi did not work and, as such, we wouldn't be able to use the Personal Device Entertainment. A six hour flight with no TVs or Wi-Fi. Unbelievable. Throughout my whole experience, the crew was incredibly rude and inattentive. Upon landing at SFO, we waited on the taxiway for 50+ minutes since (as the captain told it) United operations had screwed up and didn't have a gate for us. There were a number of passengers connecting on to other destinations, many of which there is only one flight a day to from SFO. All told, we arrived at the gate around 1.5 hours late. Combined with our delay leaving BOS, many of my fellow passengers missed their connections and had to be put up overnight. My experience on the return flight was slightly better â€” the Wi-Fi/personal device entertainment worked and the crew was more courteous â€” but the damage had been done. If I have any choice, I'll never fly with United Airlines again.\", 'united airlines Not Verified | This was my first time flying United and it was a nightmare! After being delayed for several hours we never got an update for the reason as to why. We then ended up missing our connection. Stood in customer service for over an hour.

I thought I was being pranked. I asked the workers and they said they would let us know. Never did we hear anything or get an apology. Not even a free cocktail. Heck I would have been happy with some water when waiting for so long. This was terrible and I would never fly United again. I fly 100 times a year and this is by far the worst. Do not make the mistake flying United. I thought it was just bad luck all the negutivity surrounding them but it all makes sense. We then had to have a United employee help us find the new best route possible. We thought the experience was going to get better, wrong!

The inflight entertainment was not accessible and our tablets are brand new and we had to pay an extra 100 just to be able to sit in our seat without the person next to you sitting in your lap plus we paid 50 to check one bag a piece. I have always flown United but this may be our last trip for the price of our flight I have much better expectations. I have flown internationally and all over the US on many carriers and this has by far been my worst experience and this is the 2nd time this has happened to me at this airport. I am very disappointed.', 'united airlines Not Verified | I have not flown with United in years. My experience flying from Chicago to Detroit reminded me why. The flight stays option does not label information which causes confusion when reading. This can be frustrating when making travel plans. The flight attendant was the main issue. As a representative of the company, I would think you would want your attendants to be clean looking. Not as if they were hungover from partying the night before. Hair a tangled mess and makeup smeared. Her attitude towards customers was welll below par, making faces after one gentlemen ordered extra and snarky with her responses. Needless to say I will not be returning.', 'united airlines Not Verified | My son traveled as an unaccompanied Minor from Harrisburg to El Paso with a stop in Chicago. I paid for him to have an escort & the airline did not provide an escort & left him alone the entire time. My son called me very upset that he couldnâ€™t find the terminal or gate. Every United employee he asked for help ignored him. If it wasnâ€™t for TSA. He would have missed his flight. Itâ€™s about time we stand up against the airlines for stealing our money & putting our children at risk!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sioux Falls to Louisville via Chicago. I was promised hotel compensation because my flight was delayed two hours which caused me to miss my connecting flight (no flights going out until the next day). Customer service first of all, was rude from the start (I was trying to be so patient). Then I was told â€œitâ€™s the governments fault your plane was behind so we canâ€™t offer a hotel voucher, just a discount.â€\\x9d I am now sitting in the airport overnight waiting. No meal voucher. Nothing. Thanks United. I paid hard earned money for this terrible experience. Warning: book an early flight so you can get home the same day you start traveling.', 'united airlines Not Verified | San Francisco to Newark. We boarded the airline and within a few minutes it was announced that the hydraulic system lights malfunctioned, we waited inside the plane for 2 hours. Then they asked us to get off the plane, and at a different terminal we took another United plane. We were originally scheduled to arrive at EWR at 11 pm and we arrived at 2 am. Reached home at 4 am these people are so clueless that they did not offer anything like snacks or lunch boxes as complimentary but instead we had to pay. Bad airline, bad service.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This airline sucks, tried calling and they have a telemarketer and you have to speak to it instead of pressing numbers and they can't ever get anything you say right. I've been flying with united for quite a while and now I have had enough. Had family problems come up and had a round trip planned and it costs $200 just to change the date and more money for the flight price difference. If it was cheaper I would be more understandable but when you have to pay almost $400 to get home 2 days earlier it's kind of ridiculous and I will never fly United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Washington. Used the automated check in very user friendly and easy, flight got 1.30 hours delay and flight was sold out and got delayed even more because a passenger was boarded who did not have a seat - caused some confusion and the the door had to be reopened to let the passenger out. Attendants where very friendly and live direct tv was working well. Packed snacks were served, the plane was very old and seats were worn out. The delay caused a late arrival in Dulles .', \"united airlines Not Verified | My flight was pushed back to 1 hour causing a chain reaction of people missing flights. Myself and 500 other United customers waited in the customer service line and Denver Colorado after missing our connections. Choose between going to Eugene at 7pm the following day or I'm returning to Oregon by 9am, but Portland instead of Eugene. Having to stay the night in San Francisco I asked if there was any hotel compensation and they said it was an act of God - this wasn't a very satisfying answer for me.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Maui via San Francisco. Not good. We were delayed by United. Upon finally arriving to our connecting flight we were forced to be late waiting for a gate to disembark. Once finally in the terminal, they would not let us board our connection even though the workers said they say they saw our plane arrive and knew we and others were on it. Needless to say, the connecting plane was still connected to the terminal. Had to wait an additional 3 hours for a flight. Will never fly with United again. Also most uncomfortable seats ever.', 'united airlines Not Verified | Worst customer service I have ever received from start to finish. Before even getting to the airport I called to speak to a rep in regards to my first flight being delayed and was cutting it close to the end of boarding of the connecting flight (15 minutes). I was told by the rep that they had no way of contacting the airport to let them know that there were passengers delayed from their first flight but would be arriving just as boarding closed. I asked to speak to someone else and the rep said \"I can\\'t transfer you, but you can call back and wait through it all again\", not impressed. Then at the Buffalo airport we were reassured that we would make our second flight as long as this first one left on the scheduled time still, and if not we would be given a hotel room for the night, refunded for our hotel missed and sent out at 8:40 am the next day. Well what do you know, we missed our connecting flight by 5 minutes as they closed the gates, the \"hotel\" we were told we would be given was actually all booked as their was a rally in town and we were told we could \"sleep on the safe airport floor\" by the Supervisor at Washington-Dulles. Also, the 8:40 am flight we were told we would be on was actually 12:00 pm. Now for the \"reimbursement\" we were told we would get, that was a joke. We were told we would be reimbursed for our hotel that we had to stay in (IN VIRGINIA), the hotel we missed, our cab rides etc - we were not. We were offered flight vouchers (I will never fly with them again) and then offered to be reimbursed for one night, and the cabs. Disgusting customer service. Everyone told us something different, and in the end we were out over $250 in the hotel room we missed, data overages to find accommodations and food. Book with anyone else, it is not worth the cheap ticket price.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Kansas City to Chicago. Terrible experience! Total chaos. Time to board and everyone got up and assembled a line. Then, flight was delayed an hour, then it wasnâ€™t. Then it was time to hurry up and board. The line was a disaster. No one could tell where the line was. Or, exactly what was going on. Were we boarding or were we delayed? The app wasnâ€™t updated. People were worried about getting their carry-on bags on because they kept announcing that it was a full flight and they were worried about space. So people were trying to get on plane as fast as they could to secure space. People were cutting in line and being super aggressive. The people in charge could have cared less. They were oblivious to what was going on, but seemed hurried. We finally get on plane, many had to check bags which was time consuming. Now we sit on runway. I have never seen a group of flight attendants so checked out.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I have a medical condition, as a result of neck injury, that requires medication that makes me very nauseous. It is always a problem when flying. I have vomited on the airplane in the past. The only thing that helps is sitting near the front of the plane. I booked my flight accordingly as was able to choose appropriate seats. However, my seat was changed and all United personnel refused to help me find a seat to accommodate me. Then when I arrived at my assigned seat 17D, I discovered the seat did not recline. Therefor I cannot wear my neck support either. I will never fly united again. They should be ashamed of their disregard for customer safety and comfort, as well as their terrible customer service.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Santa Barbara via San Francisco. Worst. Experience. Ever. From start to - and not even at our final destination yet. Iâ€™d give them zero stars if I could. Flight from Buffalo to Newark was delayed for 2 hours (understandable as Iâ€™ve traveled extensively in the past.) While waiting, the company tag line used on the plan to the passengers was as follows: â€œseems like its an electrical maintenance issue on Newarkâ€™s part. Sorry everyone.â€\\x9d Still relatively understandable. This made us miss our 2 other connecting flights moving forward. When trying to reroute our flights once we finally got to Newark, we asked the customer service rep for the airline to put us up in a hotel in San Francisco because weâ€™d be stuck at the airport until 8:45 am (after landing around midnight as it was the earliest flight to Santa Barbara/home.) â€œNo. It was because of weather. We donâ€™t do that if itâ€™s because of weather,â€\\x9d the customer service rep advised. At no point was the weather cited as any part of the cause for the delay! Whatever. Horrible attitudes with the employees at the gate as well. Finally we were able to get on to our re-routed flight (which, by the way, was also delayed for almost 2 hours as well.) I have a roller bag that easily fits in the overhead compartment. Before the plane was even 1/2 full, they started pulling luggage to check in. At the gate, I explained explicitly said that if I check my bag, I need to grab it from the gate itself and not have them send it directly to our final destination (Santa Barbara) or the general checked-in luggage. There was plenty of overhead space by my seat, mind you. Nope! We had to leave the gated area to the baggage carousels, where the flight attendant told us to go, and nothing. No bag. Apparently they were â€œholding itâ€\\x9d to get it on our last flight which leaves in 7 hours! I have things in there I need! And now the security checkpoint is closed so we canâ€™t even get back into a nice quiet area to find a place to sleep for even a little bit because of the sheer lack of communication, horrible customer service, and complete lack of empathy. I will never again fly with United and I hope nobody else will either.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Newark. I used to fly United 50 weeks a year for 5 years and earn platinum status. I got treated badly by big percentage of the UA staff because I wear jeans and I don't look like a business traveler. The flight crew has improved but the ground crew at Boston is still very bad. I needed verification for luggage check in and I waited for more than 10 minutes.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Worst airline ever. Midland airport is a joke, the lady working at the check in counter is the rudest lady ever. I always fly Southwest but had a Jamaica trip that required United. Will be the last time I fly with them.

Now since I have flown so much in 2 months and I have not met one nice united crew members.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to Las Vegas via Houston. Worst customer service ever and made me and my sons experience horrible. I missed my boarding time by 5mins even though my friend was on the phone with me while I was running to the gate because they told her to call me and tell me to hurry. So she got on the plane since they told her to and once she was on they told her they canceled me and my sons flight. The ramp was still connected to the plane when I was trying to get on and my friend said they hadn't even shut the plane door yet and on top of that when I looked at the flight after they took off the flight status was â€œearly departureâ€\\x9d. There was no reason to not let me on the plane and and the lady I was speaking to was rude and also the lady my friend spoke to on the plane was rude! My friend said the flight attendant had just shrugged her shoulders with a smirk on her face and said well we already canceled her and her sons flight. I had to sit in the Miami airport for 8hours with my 8year old son and they were just rude about the whole situation. Worst experience Iâ€™ve ever had.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tokyo to Boston via Washington. United has the worst customer service. I was afraid I was going to miss my connecting flight so I informed a crew member. All they had to say was: â€œwe cannot help itâ€\\x9d. I asked them if I can exit the plane first when it landed, and they refused. I missed my connecting flight and had to spend an additional 5 hours. I havenâ€™t flown United after my first-time horrific experience.

We sat at the airport for 5 hours waiting before giving up and having them send it via mail. Checked our bags in at 4.40am and it somehow didn't get to even Chicago until 5pm! Never flying with them again. They lost multiple peoples luggage that we talked to that day.\", 'united airlines â\\x9dŒ Not Verified | San Francisco to Tokyo Haneda. I\\'ve had mixed feelings about this airline. I was careless enough that the ANA ticket that I purchased was actually operated by United Airlines. The horrifying experience with them starts from customer service. I telephoned them obtaining inquiries on how a less than 24 hour transit would handle baggage. I was informed that the baggage will transfer directly to my connecting flight (which was finally, and thank heavens, ANA from Haneda to Manila). The reservation agent said that connecting within 24 hour transit will not result the baggage to be claimed in HND and will be directly handled in MNL. Fine. We checked in Day of our flight with our luggage weighing less than 50 lbs, 5 luggage due to my star alliance gold status, along with my brother\\'s normal traveler status. We were informed that the luggage will be offloaded in Haneda. This is a conflicting to the information I was provided few hours ago. The check in agent said \"You can just re-check in to your next flght\" I asked her, \"are you sure\", she was proud to answer \"NO\". Why suggest with utmost certainty to do such thing without verifying your sources. I had asked for supervisor and I was replied with \"We do not have a supervisor, he is busy!\" I am at my point of my fumes reaching to the airport\\'s ceiling on the way how I am being handled. Finally, the supervisor at that time came and handled our baggage with manual baggage tags. The check in agent even uttered \"good luck in finding these bags\", while the supervisor gave her a blank stare. These words were also added to our fiasco Agent: There is no way I will write manual airport codes with these baggage tags, they will get lost for sure. (At least she cares about my baggage possibility of being lost). Agent: Your baggage cannot be held at the airport for security purposes. Really, security purposes? I will travel with my luggage for more than 12 hours (note it will go through a strict security check, hence, adding another 12 hours should not make any difference to impose threat to security. I am not sure why United continue to impress us with their undying no customer style of service. It was not United Airlines ticket that I purchased, it was under ANA but unfortunately, the operating flight was United. The check-in agent did not offer us any help that at least by reaching Haneda, a ground staff would assist us with our luggage to connect to another airline. I guess by customer\\'s putting up their weak customer service to even lower than worst, keeps them in the market. Never again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | We were flying from STL on United to ORD. The STL departure was 10 minutes behind schedule. When we arrived at ohare at terminal B, our connecting flight started boarding at terminal F. Our ticket including on the United app said gate F16, so we ran like home alone a mile through the airport. When we arrived (F16) they had not started boarding, so My wife left her phone and bag with me to use the bathroom. They had changed the gate to f17 with no notice and told me I needed to board and theyâ€™d wait for my wife. She didnâ€™t have her phone or her ticket and I was rudely asked to board and leave my wife. They could have easily just explained let me take your carry on to load and wait for your wife. There would have been no way to communicate to my wife where she needed to go, where her bags went, and where I went. I wasnâ€™t going to strand my wife and leave her behind. Then my wife returned and sprinted to get to the gate where I flagged her down. After getting on board, the gate attendant came back and continued berating me in front of the whole plane about not leaving my wife behind and denying to board until my wife was with me. Terrible service, never flying United again. I hope this gate attendant is made to undergo public relations training and learns how to speak politely to the people to the people who are why she gets paid. Frustrating experience where I was berated by an awfully rude gate attendant for not leaving my wife in a different city because Unitedâ€™s flights werenâ€™t on time and they changed gates without any notification. Hereâ€™s to never flying with United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Two customers and I missed connecting flights to Orlando by 10 minutes due to a previously delayed United Airlines flight from Paducah. United does not care about their customers whatsoever. How could they not communicate that they made a mistake and several customers would be arriving less than 10 minutes late to boarding time. Easily the worst airline I have ever flown. Terrible customer service.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Dallas Ft Worth. This airline is a glorified Spirit Airlines, nickel and dimming you for everything. I had a personal item that fit under my seat with no issue that was checked off by an agent on my flight to Newark. On my way back the agent refused to check off this same bag and said it was a carry on and had to pay $25. I could have paid the same amount including seat selection and carry on on another airline for less had I known without the hassle and frustration. The agents were incredibly rude. I will never fly United if itâ€™s the last thing I do. Terrible experience, customer service, pricing and policies.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Moline to La Guardia via Chicago. Pathetic. They forgot to check levels of nitric oxide prior to our 6am flight from Moline. Then it took them 90 minutes to get a mechanic there to fill up the nitric oxide. We missed our connection, they then were rude trying to place us on a new flight. Then they sent us to Newark instead of La Guardia. Slow, lazy, and rude United employees cost us a day of our vacation without ever an apology.

There is no warning appears to show that if you change to lower level you won't get a refund. Only on the website does not on the APP. Lucky that I just try of 1 seat, not all 6 seats. So, I lost 1 seat of Economy plus which is under my name. All 5 others seat still stay the same and never change. I was annoyed but I got my fault I went back and rebuy my former seat with extra $69.

I understand that this can happen but itâ€™s been occurring a lot to United airplanes! And then the attendant gave me an attitude cause I was checking about the possibility to do something about my other connection flight from London to Beirut cause obviously I will be missing it for sure having the first connection delayed. I was hoping that reviews on United Airlines were wrong but unfortunately it seems most of them are true and the airline needs a lot of improvement specifically to the aircraft, and mostly to the customer service.', 'united airlines â\\x9dŒ Not Verified | Detroit to San Francisco. Terrible experience! Flight delayed 2.5 hours because of â€œfogâ€\\x9d but other airlines were still flying to the destination. I specifically packed light to use a carry on and ended up having to check my bag because the overhead space was full. Only half of the passengers were boarded at the time of my arrival and I witnessed passengers getting on the plane after me that were able to find space in the overhead bins. Expressed my concern of checking my bag with the flight attendant and she said â€œIâ€™m on the verge of tears too. I just canâ€™t right now.â€\\x9d', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I would like to start off by saying I have never been treated so rudely by any other airline staff. I was supposed to fly from Newark to Miami on May 15. Due to some of the weather we were experiencing united sent out an email stating that I was able to change my flight to an earlier flight or later flight because my flight would more than likely be delayed and or canceled. In this email it also stated that I was able to change my seat for free as long as it was in the same class cabin (economy-economy plus). I then called United to have my flight changed which would in turn change my seat. I was flying economy but the only available seats were for economy plus however that did not matter because United said that they would waive any change fees and any seat change fees. When I called to try and have my flight changed I was spoke into extremely nasty, I was told I didnâ€™t know what I was talking about, and I was told \"thatâ€™s just how it is\", when I try to explain that United had already waived the change fee for the seat and customer service was still trying to charge me $150. I was determined to get on this flight as my scheduled flight was already delayed five hours. The flight I was trying to get on was delayed an hour. I did not give up as I went to the airport went through TSA and got to my gate. I had to physically show the email to her United worker to get them to believe me. I do not understand how the company is not in sync with their employees. How are you sending out mass emails that your own employees donâ€™t know about it makes no sense at all. I was hung up on three times and treated very poorly. We used to like flying with United but lately something is gone bad. Take note from Southwest and learn how to treat your customers.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I traveled from Houston to Boston via Washington, DC on United Airlines in basic economy. It started off badly because you need help checking in at a kiosk if you are in basic economy and not checking a bag. A representative has to check if your item can got under the seat. I had one item that would go under the seat and a plastic bag full of paper work I was sorting. The United airlines attendant said could I get the small plastic bag into the other bag and I responded that I was sorting and it would be empty by the time I got to the gate. She said I am sorry but I cannot let you check in unless you put the contents of the plastic bag in the under the seat bag. I stayed at the kiosk and started the sorting through my papers. A supervisor came up and approved me saying I was only allowed one personal item, which I knew. I then went over to a seat and sorted my papers, then went through security with only one personal item. The flights were good otherwise with free soft drinks and coffee. I will fly them again in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to San Francisco. I had an absolutely horrible experience with United (as I almost always do), but this time will never use them again. I payed a lot of extra money for a late flight one evening (8 pm), and then they kept delaying it due to â€œweatherâ€\\x9d in San Francisco, even though every other airlineâ€™s flights had no delays or cancellations to SF. They eventually cancelled my flight due to said weather at 10:45 pm (another United flight to SF at 11 pm that night took off without delays so I know it wasnâ€™t weather). Then I had to get in line for an agent to rebook, which was >100 people long. In the hour I waited, I called United and was placed on a â€œ5-10 minute holdâ€\\x9d that was actually >30 minutes, only to tel me thereâ€™s nothing they can do. When I got to the agent finally, around midnight, he rebooked me for an AM flight and gave me a 35% discount to nearby hotels but no free stay since the cancellation was â€œout of their control.â€\\x9d He promised me that if I payed for the hotel however, that United would reimburse me no questions asked. I confirmed this several times and he literally promised me this is the case. I payed $100 for the nearest hotel and spent the night. I filed the complaint to get my money back and they replied 5 days later with a short email saying they will not reimburse me anything but hope I can overloo this and continue to use their airline... I called United to clarify and they said customers are unable to speak to customer service on the phone, only email. This has been an infuriating process and I will certainly never use United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Albuquerque to Raleigh Durham via Denver. This has got to be the worst experience with an airline. Never in my life have a missed a flight and due to unforeseen circumstances we were running a bit behind. When checking in our bags there was a further delay due to some baglogs with the luggageâ€™s. Since we were running behind, we asked how we were doing on time for boarding and the lady looked at our bags and said we had plenty of time. Then the TSA line was running very slow and were not able to do anything for us to expedite the process. We run to our gate and we find the gate closed but the desk attendant was opening the door for a passenger, but then as she is closing the door while the plane is still there, she just says YOUâ€™VE MISSED YOUR FLIGHT. - again, she had just opened the door for a man right in front of us. The plane was Still there for another 7-10 minutes before it got disconnected from the bridge! Now there is no other flight to get us home until midnight, minded that we pleaded with her and told her that we have another flight to catch in the morning to Chicago. I understand the policy of getting to the airport with plenty of time to spare, unfortunately our morning was filled with issues that held us back. I donâ€™t know what was going on with her day but that sure is not a way to show customer service. She was also rude and not cared one bit about our situation. I hope that as a corporation you are also training you employees about customer service, care, and a bit more of humanity. Neither her nr her manager at the ABQ airport showed neither of the characteristics of a position that requires customer service characteristics.

This is the second time I have had an issue with terrible customer service with United in the last 8 months. The last time they would not let me cancel a ticket when I had bought trip insurance.

The rising wall between the two middle seats, of which I was travelling on one malfunctioned and sadly it came down and wouldn't return to the up position.

After all the passengers were boarded after the very long wait, there was a further delay of 1 hour because of their mistakes in fixing some doors. We missed our check in time at New Jersey and arrived really late. Will never fly with this airline again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Nashville via Chicago. Our flight from Orlando to chicago was delayed by about an hour and a half due to weather, which in return caused us to miss the connecting flight from chicago to nashville, which was fine, however the man we spoke to first and worked the gate next to the customer service area was rude told me I could not talk to a supervisor then told me he would call one, so he picked up the phone said nothing hung up and said one would be right there, never saw a supervisor, then as his shift was ending and i was still standing there he said 'did one come?' I said no he said ok have a nice drive home laughed and left. The customer service people weren't really wanting to help my family get home finally gave in and put us on a different airline. This is the worst airline to go through, if you can spend a little extra go through someone else unless you are into getting stranded.\", 'united airlines â\\x9dŒ Not Verified | This airline is no better than Spirit or Frontier or any of the other cut-rate airlines out there. The staff was rude and gave us little information about our flight delay. Our flight was delayed for 4 hours! First, they claimed it was maintenance issues, in which case they would have to pay us for the delay. Then, they claimed it was suddenly the weather. What? Trust me when I say the weather was not bad and wouldâ€™ve cleared up completely by the time we got to Chicago. The staff did little to try to inform us about what was going on. Trust me, it doesnâ€™t make a difference if you fly with a legacy carrier or not! They suck just as bad as Spirit!', 'united airlines â\\x9dŒ Not Verified | Chicago to Charleston. Traveled with Frontier Airlines this weekend and it was delayed 7 hours and wasnâ€™t sure if the flight was even going to leave the airport. Had to Book last minute within the airport with United Airlines so I could get home, since Frontier didnâ€™t have another flight until the following weekend. Had 2 checked bags and a carry on. United doesnâ€™t allow carry on bags. I had to check all three for 210$ because I was already inside the airport and didnâ€™t have anything else and had no choice. Baggage fees are ridiculous and both airlines were not helpful in this situation.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I traveled from Boston to Houston on United Airlines in basic economy. I was originally routed through Chicago but when I found out my flight was waiting an aircraft I asked the customer desk to look into the matter. They changed my flight giving me a direct flight to Houston. The flight was uneventful and arrived 20 minutes before scheduled arrival time. I originally had three seats but the steward told me to vacant the third seat for a man who I suspect was a United employee. Overall a good flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | So unhappy with United! On our way to Las Vegas our flight was delayed 3 hours which made it impossible to get our flight mid way, so we had to get a flight 6 hours after which means we ended up being in an airport for 12+ hours. Not only this but we didnâ€™t even receive a notification that it was delayed so we couldnâ€™t even go back home or do anything but just sit. Then they refused to let us sit together, on any of our flights, luckily there was one person who offered to switch seats. They acted like because we paid for the cheaper seats thatâ€™s how we were gonna be treated. We couldnâ€™t even take a carry on with our flight it was just ridiculous. We flew Delta a little less than a year before this and paid for the same type of ticket and when we asked if we could sit next to each other they said no problem at all and allowed us to have a carry on. United also overbooked our flight by 5 people, I donâ€™t understand how do you overbook? Plus when we got our flight we had to PAY to watch anything on their little TVs, where in Delta itâ€™s paid for. I donâ€™t get any of this. Just doesnâ€™t make sense to me! Just not happy with them at all. We will never again fly United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | CancÃºn to Nashville via Chicago. United airlines is terrible. They postponed our flight twice in Cancun then promised we should still make our flight in Chicago to Nashville. We arrive in Chicago and the gate changed 5 different and kept getting postponed from 7:30p.m and finally gets cancelled at 12:00am, after spending 3 hrs in customer service line we get told the only flight out is 24hrs later and there are no accommodations. I will never fly United again. I would never suggest united airlines to anyone.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Are you joking United? On my flight TO EWR from SEA, I had a 3 hour delay. Now on my flight from EWR to SEA, thereâ€™s a 25 min delay which turns into a 1 hour delay, which turns into a last minute gate change far away (just getting out of physical therapy mind you) which turns into another gate change back to original gate after I had made my way over to the new one and everyone is now still waiting in line with the aircraft yet to be seen. What are you guys doing? This is 2018 - learn about customer service - wouldâ€™ve thought you should have learnt from all your mistakes in this area by now with all the lawsuits and bad press. Never flying United again, back to Alaska for me. Horrible experience.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City via Denver. Did somebody shrink the size of the international carry on size? Or is it just United Airlines? Wouldn't let us bring our carry on as it didn't fit in their sample carry on box. It fit in Southwest's just fine. Non-existent customer service. We were not rude, just asked why it was small compared the other airlines. Not even about the 25$. Just tired of dealing with people trying to nickle and dime. Thought for a minute I was dealing with dish network or comcast. I always regret not flying with tried and true Southwest!\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Heathrow terminal 2 was pleasant enough and boarding started on time. The plane is old and lacks in a few places: built in screen was tiny and showed movies on a loop. The irony is they ask you to use your own device but don't provide any power. I could not get the app to work, I didn't try to find a flight attendant because I had a book. Seat was 25K in the extra legroom and they made it clear you could not just move into this section. I'd rather fly a 2-3-2 layout 767 than a 3-3-3 787. It's such as shame that the modern aircraft are so horrendously tight so you have a choice of space but old IFE/no power or IFE/power but really narrow seats. The legroom was not spectacular given the $140 cost. Food was poor. Chicken or pasta. I had the chicken and the liquid tasted like stewed tea. Didn't finish it and could see others left it. Snack before landing was much nicer. This was a very expensive ticket due to my particular needs for a specific day / route for work so I understand but it is still galling to know I surely paid more than a few of the business class passengers to sit back here.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I had the smoothest and the most comfortable ride on my flight back to Denver from Dallas. The flight crew was great. The only problem I had was at security at DFW. The United ticket agent cleared my under seat carry on. The power trip lady made get out of line and go back to the agent that cleared me when my under the seat carry on fitted on the check your baggage size. This cost me another 20 minutes in going back through a line that I had been in just for someone to say ok. This would be the only reason I would not fly United anymore. The power trip lady would cause me not to travel with them anymore. I understand security by all means protect me and my fellow Americans but a bag. For real.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Chicago. If you fly United you better get used to delays. Worst airline service ever. I fly almost every week, mostly of the time by United, but thinking seriously about a change to Delta.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to London via Newark. This airline is unbelievably incompetent. I scheduled a flight from Houston to London to attend my motherâ€™s wedding and it was canceled, delayed, then canceled again. I now have to buy $7k worth of British Airways flights so I can arrive on time and attend her wedding. After going to customer service for a refund they stated Iâ€™m Not eligible for a refund and told me good luck. I will never fly with United again. If you want to spend a few grand and a few days stuck in an airport, choose United!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Saint Louis. After spending hours at the airport as the flight continued to be postponed until finally canceled due to â€œweather conditionsâ€\\x9d - when other airlines did not and the weather was fine in both cities, the customer service provided was very poor. I spent almost one hour to be able to rebook the flight and thank God I tried to check in right away with my reservation number because the email confirmation I supposed to receive never arrived. Then I found out that I did not have a seat assigned on my connecting flight when my wife did and I was never told that.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United Airlines from Kansas City to Houston. Arrived at MCI with my usual bags I travel with, when Iâ€™m trying to print off the boarding pass, this rude employee comes up to me saying you need to check this bag on, I said no, I have never had to before. She made me as there was a wheel outside of the bin for $25. I was not planning on spending $25 for a bag nor the wait when I get off the plane. Every single airline I have flown with in the past (frequent flyer) Iâ€™m just fine with my carry on. The bins go length ways so it would have been 100% just fine. Itâ€™s obvious this airline just wants your money.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Barcelona via Newark. Delayed and the circled in the air due to \"weather\" - checked Newark weather didn\\'t see anything. Plane then rerouted to Cleveland because they didn\\'t have enough fuel. All the while other planes were landing in Newark, including planes that left Denver after us. In Cleveland took 3 hours for plane to take off again. All the while the customer service reps were no where to be found to try to schedule a new flight for the missed connection. The desk was empty and united employees at the gates just stared at us and didn\\'t even call over anyone to help any of us when we asked them. Once we finally found someone they were no help at all, just telling us to try to get to Newark and have customer service there rebook us. If we cant find anyone at 7 pm in a customer service kiosk in Cleveland, how are we supposed to find customer service reps at 1 am when we get to newark, 7 hours after we were supposed to originally get there.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London to San Francisco airport return. The food was absolutely disgusting. I advise not to travel with United . It is not worth whatever you pay.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Orlando. Extremely disrespectful staff by the gate (the first time I interact with them personally) wanted to charge me for an extra bag for my crossbody that only carries my phone(cause i have no pockets, and I carry a note 8, big phone to carry and too expensive to lose). Inflight Crew is rude, they throw the snack at you, literally - anything you request on the flight, you will be treated with attitude. I asked for spirit, then saw they had Ginger, I asked to change it, the attendant literally snatched the cup from my hands and looked at me like I was begging for money. The worst disrespectful, rude, disgusting service.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Saginaw. This was the last leg of an international flight for me. They bumped me off of my scheduled flight before I even arrived, which I understood as it was a bit tight, but I would have made it. Than 15 minutes before we were due to board they delayed the flight, just a little bit, then a little more then a little more. Now itâ€™s over 5 hours later and the plane still isnâ€™t here. The worst part is that it wasnâ€™t until after the 5 hour mark that anyone even told us what was going on. No one around to answer questions. This is a business trip so unfortunately I had no choice in the carrier, but I will be sending an email to our travel guys and ask them to avoid using United in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Veracruz to Houston. Rude, as always. Told the stewardess that the non-english speaker next to me needed a seat belt extension and I was told not to do her job. Was told to stop using my phone while the plane was still parked and the lady just kept standing looking at me until i turned it off. I am aware I have to turn it off and will of course do so but it was not said very nicely. It is always the same but for some reason they keep having the only international route out of veracruz.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to West Palm Beach. Flight was almost empty with about 40 passengers. My son is 6â€™4 tall and we had paid already extra $17 for just reserving the seats together. Crew insisted we canâ€™t change seats even though 70 percent of aircraft was empty. So most of passengers were squeezed in 3 rows. Last time flying with United. This is free, just being kind to your customers.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Just when you think United canâ€™t possibly get any worse, they prove you wrong. The staff on the flight from Houston to Frankfurt were surly, unhelpful and generally more concerned with chatting in the galley than taking care of customers in Business Class. Food quality has been in steady decline for years as has the wine choices. No drinks offered before departure even when specifically asked for. compared to the other airlines, United has become a budget airline but with premium prices. Management please take note! Now letâ€™s get to the cabin itself. Foot rest was broken, literally in half. Seat sound system did not function. Time to change my allegiance.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Honolulu. I had the most stressful time trying to rebook a flight I wasnâ€™t going to make. I talked to three agents and my phone dropped the call twice. Finally I was given a phone number to call and the person that answered was amazing, he helped me out in finding a new flight for the best price, even though it wasnâ€™t with United, and refunding me for the flight I had missed. After a stressful morning it was so nice having his help and it makes me want to fly with United more!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Washington Dulles. They made us go to baggage claim for your carry-on. This is nonsense. We wanted to avoid baggage claim so we did carry-on but they made us to do baggagw claim anyway because the cabin is full. This is a bad design and bad customer service. They didn't even bring the bags to us which they took from us involuntarily. Very narrow seats and uncomfortable.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Jose to Chicago. No food provided on the 4 hour flight. I was in row 35, and they ran out of food by row 30! It was an early flight, so no chance for breakfast, then I connected to another United flight will no time for food between. So, very poor performance. No apology from the staff - not their fault, though. Also a crummy little plane with no room, considering the length of the flight. No screens for movies, and no is to charge my phone. It was on time, so that's the main thing.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Norfolk to Los Angeles via Washington. Going into Norfolk was ok. But coming back was the worst experience ever. No room for my small carryall on the flightfrom Norfolk to DC do it was sent cargo all the way to LAX. I asked for a fragile tag and was told they would put that tag in my expensive carryall. That was not done. My carryall was scratched. My seat on the flight to LAX was truly a nightmare of discomfort. The phone charger under the seat. And you had no mobility. No food â€” just pretzels. You need to pay me for replacing my carryall and the broken things. Very irresponsible. I dislike United attitude.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Tucson. Nice people, clean planes. Entertainment is lousy. On American Airlines I can download the app in flight. On United you have to download the app before the flight, no one tell you this until you get to see it at 10,000 feet. I purchased the inflight internet. It is so bad, I still canâ€™t download the app. Thanks for wasting my time. Iâ€™m not approving any more United Flights.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to West Palm Beach . They make you check your carry on, saying bins are full. You get in plane and lots of bin space to put carry on. No one using common sense - bad customer service, flight attendant agreed with me and apologized. Had to wait at luggage claim for carry on.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Nashville . Today, I remember why I avoid United Airlines at all costs. Not that I hadn\\'t forgotten their unfriendly behavior in the past before, but you would think that after so much bad press and negative publicity, they would care to be more courteous to their customers and try to accommodate them more (at least more than competing airlines). You would think, but you would be wrong. United acts as if they are a \"preferred\" airline when really, I cringe at the thought of ever having to fly them. The only reason to consider them is cost, but you are giving up severe customer service while on board, while on the phone, or while trying to accommodate any emergencies that may come up. Their cancellation policy is bizarre and it isn\\'t even clear on how you can cancel a flight on their website (it\\'s not under their refunds/cancellations tab).', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Detroit. I encountered the rudest and most unprofessional flight attendant. About 20 minutes after take off I had to use the restroom. I\\'m sitting towards the front of the plane in economy just next to the lavatory. It\\'s lock and I haven\\'t seen anyone go in or out. I look around the plane people are moving about and using the rest room in the rear of the plane. I proceed to head to the back of the plane to use the facilities when the flight attendant tells me to return to my seat. I explain my urgency and she proceeds to call me out over the intercom. I used the lavatory and proceeded back to my seat. She is now standing in the isle with the drink cart at my seat. With a disgusted tone she looks at the other attendant and says \"Let me guess he\\'s sitting right here\" They both look at me like I have an arm growing out the side of my head and proceeds to tell me that there is a restroom right here, like I\\'m incapable of figuring that out on my own. I explain that it is locked! She flips the lavatory sign up and unlocked the door. What has happened to customer service these days? I guess you get what you pay for.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to St. Louis. Was 25 mins before board time and was not allowed to get my boarding pass, despite an empty security line and short walk to the gate. Customer service was rude and then thought replacing my ticket with a flight 7 hours later was acceptable. I was trying to see my little sisters college graduation, and I decided to try and catch my first flight and switch tickets back once I got to the gate. However, United had sold my seat in less than 10 mins, which makes me wonder if I actually had the seat in the first place? Overall, horrible experience. I ended up driving to a different airport and catching a flight on Southwest. On my way back to Houston, I wasn\\'t allowed to print my boarding pass because I checked the box marked \"no checked bags.\" Customer service lady was rude again and told me I would be charged $25 at the gate if I did not check my bag (which was a backpack). She proceeded to tell me that my \"cheap\" ticket did not come with guaranteed overhead bin space. Went to the gate and had no problem with the staff or using bin space. Didn\\'t make sense why she would tell me that. I\\'ve always flown southwest and for some reason ended up with these United flights. They will be my last.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My family and I were traveling from Denver to SÃ£o Paulo via Houston, and our international flight was delayed (11 hours) due to mechanical problems. United provided accommodation, but the staff was unnecessarily rude with passengers. We were all tired (we waited for almost 3 hours inside the plane until they decided to delay the flight for the next day), but little information was provided. For the ones who had connecting flights (that would be missed), the staff simply stated that they were off duty. Iâ€™ve heard and read about United lack of care with customers, but the way we were treated was lack of human decency. United never again!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | After a 2 hour maintenance delay and then having to deplane then reboard after another hour, I barely made my connecting flight and had to run through O'Hare to race to my gate. I barely made it to my connecting flight. Then I got on my plane to Honolulu which is a 9.5 hour flight. They told us there would not be wifi or entertainment available. 45 minutes later the pilot comes on and says we might need to deplane and there could be an hour delay because of some problems they were having with their entertainment system. I'm frustrated because I am anxiously going to see my husband coming home from a 7 month deployment. I also spent a lot of money on this flight. Worst flying experience ever. Never ever flying with United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Charleston to Newark. I have flown with United for 4 years consistently now and have never had such a horrible experience as today. Customer service was terrible, no help was given, and no solution so I am now flying Delta. I arrived almost an hour and half before my flight - at 5:30am, bags paid for online and check in online done. All I needed to do was put my bags on the flight and get on security line - the line was so long that they pushed the 6:50am flight customers to the front, but when one woman complained about it, they sent us back and said that the flights would stand by for us since so many of us were on those flights. Being sent to the back of the line made me not get to security until 6:25am, with boarding ending at 6:30am. Furious no one could help me or would, and I managed to run to the gate and miss my flight by 5 minutes. I planned according as I have done for every single flight I have ever taken out of Charleston, and missed my flight because of incompetence and the disregard of United and airport employees. When I called to try and book another flight the representative was also extremely unhelpful only offering the most expensive routes or flights for tomorrow when I needed to be home today. When we mentioned I would be taking Delta he started badmouthing Delta and how it would be better to take United - rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful. The horrid stories of this airline disregarding customers needs or even attempting to be helpful have never been more evident than today and I am overjoyed with the care and kindness shown by Delta airlines. There is no doubt in my mind I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to London. United is horrible. We paid $1,100 to upgrade to First Class 8-9 months prior to the flight. Get to the airport and we are NOT upgraded. They say we paid to be in a waitlist. They say they will refund our money (and 40,000 miles) ASAP. I get my credit card statement and they have only refunded $550! Why? Both our flights were on the same ticket. Iâ€™ve complained three times, only to get emailed back by three different people. They have not offered me one little thing for a big inconvenience of not flying first class, much less trying to scam me out of $550. We fly pretty often and we are done with United!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Grand Rapids to Brussels via Chicago. Our first plane was grounded for maintenance, and were stuck in GR for 4 hours. We missed a day of vacation, lost our personal pick up, lost a day at the hotel and our first class Euro train tickets. I paid for German airlines and United messed up so bad we had to take United to New Jersey. Our New Jersey flight was taking off late but had to be returned do to an passenger not being able to fly. I had to rebuy my euro train pass for twice what I originally paid and later then my original ticket. When we got to Brussels there was an extra security check just for United. Our seats were not on the ticket, even though I bought the tickets 4 months ago. On the way home from Brussels the scheduled the flight so tight that we had to rush to make the plane. You were not able to buy any food on the plane either. When we got to Chicago, again the transfer flight was so close we barely had time to get through customs with a few minutes to spare running through the terminal. But it was ok because they didn't have a plane to fly. We were another 2 hours late getting home due to no plane and when they got a plane it was held up for maintenance problems again. Most of the time me and my girlfriend didn't even get to sit next to each other. So after paying for a hotel stay we didn't use, extra 100 dollars in taxi fees, airlines I specifically paid for and was not able to use, an extra 300 dollars in euro train fares and lost time visiting my very close friend I had not seen in 6 years. United said the best they could do was give me 60 dollars in food vouchers. It was a horrible experience. I feel so bad for the two employees out of 15 that actually were nice.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Newark. Flight was delayed 45 minutes to board and another 45 minutes in the aircraft for take off clearance. I was very anxious because i had a connection after Newark and it was doubtful i could make it. I asked the flight attendant and she couldnâ€™t care less - she told me call your travel agent. Can you believe that. At that time a male flight attendant also on business class told me that if there is a problem United will book me on the next flight and told me not to worry. How hard was what be did? He was probably the only one paying attention to the training. Also the power socket on my seat was off. Again the female attendant turned her head the other way. The male attendant just said give me your cell phone i will have it charged for you. Again so simple.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to Seattle via San Francisco. This was the worst flight weâ€™ve ever flown on and we were a party of 7, 5 children and two adults we had to sit on the plane for three hours before it took off and they didnâ€™t take off - going to San Francisco should have it gone to Denver to refill with fuel and then it flew to San Francisco. Instead of getting there at approximately 10:00 PM we got there at 2am with five kids and the employees on the aircraft were super rude to our teenage kids. United airlines has the worst customer service weâ€™ve ever seen on an airline they are just completely horrible they donâ€™t take care of their passengers, especially people traveling with children. We had to stay in San Francisco overnight and then get all split up with the family because there were seven of us to be able to get flown home my husband left with four children at 9:45 and I could not get a flight with my other son until 4 oâ€™clock the next day. It was completely horrible the process of getting rebooked took over two hours in the night time with nobody waiting in line and we had to have five people help us to get this all sorted out with the manager stepping in.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Slow, thats how I feel everything goes on this airline. On my flight to visit family I didnâ€™t make it to my destination until approx 26 hours from when I boarded the first flight. 3 flights later. We sat on tarmac at LAX for who knows (no one knew) said something with the bathrooms. They need to step up the efficiency made me miss my connecting. Sat on the plane for over an hour when I was almost the last one to board on the way back. This is just becoming commonplace with United I think. Please, people, we have places to be!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tel Aviv to San Francisco. Polaris business class seat configuration of 2x2x2 in this Boeing 787-8. Not a typical configuration and a bit out of date set up. The seats are flat bed but all the lower part is not 180 degrees so if you are tall this seat is not comfortable at all â€“ half part of your leg are in a strange angle. Food is not eatable and very basic. Service in minimal. Overall they do the minimum to take you in a 15hr flight. This time with no entertainment system at all -it was broken for all passengers', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I was a bit nervous about flying United because I've heard so many bad reviews, but we flew from Dublin to Tampa via Washington and then Tampa to Dublin via Newark and on all 4 flights we were met with nothing but courtesy, efficiency, friendliness and helpfulness. There were delays encountered on the Tampa to Newark flight due to weather, but we were kept informed all along the way and were even booked onto a standby connection should we have missed our original connection in Newark. We caught the connection with minutes to spare and fully expected our luggage to miss the flight, but to our surprise and delight it was right there on the carousel when we arrived in Dublin. There was an off-duty Cabin Crew member sitting next to us on the Tampa to Newark flight and she was also helpful and friendly, even though she was off-duty. She got information for us about our connecting flight and showed us where the gate was. I would have no problem in recommending United to anyone, and will definitely be flying with them again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Quebec to Newark. The staff was incredibly nice, but they had to follow whatever United airlines policy was. I was in Quebec City, where they speak both English and French. My carry on bag was forcefully checked in to be in cargo and it was not handled delicately, I was not told to take my laptop or valuables out, at least not in English, and my screen cracked in the process. I don't blame the staff, I blame a lack of communication and United Airlines wanting to check people's bags in so they don't have to deal with people needing to get their belongings out. Also, who ever handled cargo almost lost my luggage, I had to wait almost 24 hours to find out if they found it because it was a late transfer to the right connecting flight. From the update I got, it was in Chicago when my connecting flight was from Newark to San Jose.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I have flown international numerous times and never has my checked luggage been so neglected than with United Airlines on my last trip from Taipei to Raleigh Durham via San Francisco. My luggage was left in the rain and all of my personal belongings were soaked and beginning to smell after nearly 24 hours of traveling. Once home, I was still able to ring out some of my clothing but multiple books, journals and magazines were ruined, swollen and tearing because they had been wet for hours. I was shocked no one even mentioned this to me or took responsibility for everything in the suitcase getting damaged. Luckily, my laptop and other electronics were with me as carry on baggage or they too would have been ruined. I would not trust United Airlines with my personal belongings in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Was not looking forward to the flights due to previous reviews. ZRH to EWR was fine, food OK (nothing special) but plenty of drinks runs and nice snack before landing. EWR to DEN full and late but staff did their best to dispell fears of tight connections. No food offered in Economy, even for a 4+ hrs flight! Soft drinks offered (and nice cabin crew gave a hot pizza, which was appreciated). DEN to RNO full and free entertainment given due to late departure. Overall, UA does not offer a sophisticated product but every member of staff I encountered was smiling, helpful and professional.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Phoenix to Houston to Orlando. My experience with United was superior! They went above and beyond to assist me. I missed my flight because of a traffic issue on the way to the airport. I was rebooked and arrived just 3 hours late, my seats were upgraded. I asked for nothing. After collecting my luggage for a 10 day vacation I went to the auto rental to pick up my car. It was there that I realized I had lost my wallet. A first for me and quite problematic. No license, no money, no credit cards , no atm. No ID at all. The car rental bluntly said, no license,no car! And so abruptly ended my vacation plans because I was to drive nearly 3 hrs to my destination. I was traveling solo. After filing a lost wallet report, I headed back to the United counter to see what I could do. By this time it was 8pm. The agents got very busy on their computers for reasons I did not know. Ultimately, they handed me a voucher for a hotel room, a thermos filled with toiletries , 2 meal vouchers and a return ticket to Phoenix in the morning at 8:30am. While it was a crisis situation for me, their concern and consideration went well beyond anything I expected. I was so very grateful for their assistance and to United Airlines.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Kalamazoo. The heat was on so high, I felt sick. Everyone around me agreed. I asked the flight attendant and she rolled her eyes at me and ignored me when I asked if it could be turned down a bit. Customer service sucks. No smile, not polite, and plain irritating.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I unfortunately had an awful experience with United Airlines. Initially, my flight was to be a series of connections from Alexandria - Houston - Chicago - Toronto. Weather delays caused the entire chain of my connections to be missed and land me in Toronto too late to catch my next flight with a different airline. So, they rerouted me so that my connections were now Alexandria-Houston-Toronto. United Airlines refused to compensate me in any way shape or form because they claimed that if I have to catch another flight with another airline, that is not their problem. You are an airline, your job is to get me from point A to point B, how you are refusing to do that is beyond me. I was then forced to reschedule the flight I had missed for another day, but of course I arrive back in Toronto and United Airlines had left my luggage at Houston airport. When I retrieved my luggage the following day, a wheel had been broken, forcing me to purchase another suitcase for the flight I had rescheduled. Not happy.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Customer service sucks. Our United Airlines flight arrived late due to surprise de-icing? We arrived at gate 94 just in time to watch them close the door in front of us. The gate attendant, refused to make any attempt to get us on the plane and quickly rehearsed her \"It\\'s not my problem\" script. We next had the misfortune of meeting the operations manager for United in Denver. He repeated the same \"It\\'s not my problem\" script and then repeatedly refused to even help us to the customer service desk. Complete apathy and lack of ownership. The only small respite was a staff member who reluctantly agreed to help us complete a reimbursement request.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Newark to Savannah. I fly 4-6 times a year but never United. I have to say, I now know what all of the negative public reviews are about. I was yelled at by the boarding guy because he told me my bag was not compliant with flight regulations. I told him that my bag was compliant but that I had my handbag stacked on top which made it look bigger. He held up the line and made me place the bag in the size checker. I took out my shower shoes which I had just placed in the front pocket and he tried to publicly humiliate me as if I were senile if my bag at the gate. My husband told him that I literally just put them in the front pocket because they were in my hand bag and he was so rude and obnoxious to my husband whom never speaks and is a proper gentleman. Due to Initedâ€™s notorious treatment of its customers, I told my husband it was not worth it and letâ€™s just let her get on with it as my bag clearly fit and was compliant with regulations. I guess my point is never ever again will I fly this airline!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Newark. The flight delayed for 7 hours because of waiting for aircraft. We had to fly with different airline to get to our destination on time to attend an important event. Furthermore, without notification, our seats on a return flight was automatically cancelled. As a result, we have to take a much later flight to go back home. Our overall experience with United airlines has been terrible!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | London to Washington. United's Polaris Business Class service on this flight was efficient and friendly. The 787's business class arrangement is a bit better than that of the 777, but still lags behind the comfort of some of its competitors. Still, the food has been upgraded somewhat, but gone are some of the original Polaris amenities - ie., the second pillow, the bloody mary carts, etc. Slippers must be asked for. Overall it was comfortable with generally good service. Entertainment choices are immense. My main course, ravioli, was a bit too undercooked for my taste. I did not take the second meal, but it looked quite tasty. My only real complaint here would be the state of the toilet which was a mess within a couple hours of takeoff. Obviously no crew member ever looked. But it would be nice if United had someone straighten up the toilet at least once during the flight.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Oklahoma City. Flight was delayed for maintenance at Sea Tac airport. They told us it would be about 17 minutes and we would make all connecting flights. Then it was delayed 30 minutes, then an hour before they finally boarded us. They told me I still might make my connecting flight from Denver to OKC, but if not, they would switch my flight to Tulsa which took off 35 minutes later. She said they'd take care of everything mid-air. They told us on the plane there would be CS reps to help us with our connections. It was one guy who simply asked where you were going and he'd direct you to the gate. I walked 30+ gates away to get to my connecting flight. They didn't have me in the system, and didn't have my luggage transferred. He sent me back to a United customer service desk that turned out to be closed when I got there. He closed the gate, so I couldn't make Tulsa either. So I had to go back 30 gates, stand in line for 2 hours, and be told I wouldn't be able to get to OKC until about 12:30. There were so many people in the customer service line, not just people from our flight. I didn't see this with any other airline as I walked through DIA. Once I finally got through the long line, the lady at the Customer Service desk was friendly and helpful as she could be given the circumstances, but United really blew it and I missed my mother's funeral. I will never fly your airline again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Washington via Newark. This is the most terrible airline in the world. My flight was delayed and then my airline was understaffed causing me to miss my layover flight. There were no more flights to DCA for the rest of the night so they put me on a little plane and flew me to Richmond (three hours from my house) so I could then take a taxi all the way home. In the meantime losing my luggage and getting that three days later. Cherry on top - they refuse to give me a refund.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nightmare Experience. Flying from Edmonton to Norfolk. Spent 2 hours on the tarmac in Denver before flying to Newark. Newark was cancelling and delaying flights left and right. United rebooked me onto a flight to Norfolk 30 hours later and I was not going to waste a day in Newark. My fiance said he would drive to Richmond to come get me if I could book a flight there. First time rebooking to Richmond, the United Service Assistant was very rude and didn\\'t seem to care about my situation. Ripped up my luggage tag, as it was on the back of my boarding pass, even though I had asked for it back and rebooked me on a flight to Richmond that left at 6.30. It was 6.20. Had to run down to the shuttle to get from Terminal C to Terminal A in order to get to my gate. Plane was gone by the time I got there. Stood in another customer service line to get onto another flight to Richmond. This service assistant was a lot more helpful and seemed like he cared. So thank you to him. Got me booked onto the next flight out to Richmond that night. Got to Richmond and my luggage was not there. Spoke to a luggage assistant there who was really kind and was able to locate my luggage without the luggage tag. Luggage was in Newark still and I could expect to see it delivered the following morning. I\\'ve been here for 2 days now and still do not have my luggage. Everytime I check or call the number all I\\'m told is that \"staff are still in the process of locating my luggage\". What happened? It feels like after I landed in Newark and the flights to Norfolk were cancelled that my luggage just got tossed aside somewhere and now they can\\'t find it. That or it feels like it\\'s not a priority to them. Maybe I\\'m being selfish, but I literally only have the clothes on my back and what was in my carry-on with me. I have prescriptions in my luggage that I\\'m going without. I leave in 3 weeks, so I hope to have my luggage by then. But I\\'m considering cancelling and rebooking my return trip with someone else because I don\\'t want to have to relive this nightmare again. Wouldn\\'t recommend to my worst enemy.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Sacramento. Terrible service and attitude. I travel for a living and will continue to avoid flying with them unless itâ€™s the last option! Bags were also late. It would seem fairly simple to me that service with a smile should be of the upmost priority. Hopefully they can and will put effort into fixing their issues.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sacramento to San Francisco. I had some trouble with the self check-in and the staff that helped me were plain rude and arrogant. They showed no interest in helping me out and rolled there eyes at my questions. I had never used the machines before and the staff made me feel like the most stupid person on Earth. When my bag were checked in the man behind the counter threw my bag on the belt, no respect at all. The staff on the plane were lovely but that is ruined by the bad impression at check-in. United should have a talk with their staff about customer treatment!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My fiancÃ©e and I booked our vacation back in September, so this should have been a very smooth trip. A couple days before our flight to Denver which was supposed to connect us to Vegas, United Airlines decided to switch our connecting flight and not update us about the change in connecting flights. Our new connecting flight was now leaving out of Washington D.C ten minutes after we were supposed to land. 1) Nobody can get off a plane and sprint down the terminal to board. 2) Our first flight out of Newark was delayed so our connecting flight left before we even landed in D.C. Now we have lost a day of vacation and hotel reservations that we canâ€™t get a refund. We received a response from a United rep saying we could get more leg room on our next connecting flight, which is only 1 hour. I lost a day of vacation and only get maybe an extra foot of leg room on a one hour flight? No thank you. By far the worst experience flying and you can bet that I wonâ€™t be flying United Airlines ever again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Norfolk to Boston via Newark. I have never written a review about a service before, but my experience was so bad with United that I felt compelled to. I had a round-trip from Norfolk(VA) to Boston(MA) with a connecting flight through Newark(NY.) Every flight was delayed or canceled -not delayed by a few minutes but hours. Delayed flights caused me to miss my connecting flights and have to rebook another flight. Delayed flights are one thing that I am capable of letting go. However, they didn\\'t even load my bag on a flight home. When i asked about it they simply said \"Oh it was supposed to come on an earlier flight but it got canceled.\" Okay so it was just forgotten? It feels like if the bags don\\'t go as originally planned they get tossed somewhere and forgotten until I have to call them multiple times. Still currently waiting for my checked bag to come here on the next flight from Newark to Virginia. I was told it would be coming on flight 4925 - that flight was this morning. It\\'s still in Newark. And I asked if they can be sure if my bag will make it on the next flight this afternoon, but they can\\'t even confirm that. I\\'ll just have to wait until they feel like sending it on the next flight. Who knows when that is. Completely terrible experience that I have never had before. I suppose you pay for what you get. terrible service.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Redmond to San Diego. I called a United to change a ticket I purchased with my United Airline credit card through the Hopper app. The Hopper app keeps an eye on all the airline prices and compares them for you. It will then alert you when an airline has dropped ticket prices. When I called United to change my ticket to use for another day, I fully expected to pay the usual $125.00 change fee. I was told that since I used the Hopper app, which they consider to be a travel agency, that I was going to be charged $200.00 along with $125.00 change fee. For a total of $325.00. Nice work United Airlines for completely ripping off your customer.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City with a change of planes in San Francisco to SLC (1 hr 32 min.) Airline travel is hard enough without punitive agents. On March 31 we were making a coast-to-coast trip after our cruise. Our return tickets from Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City were with United purchased through Expedia. Our day started at 4 am. Most airlines that I know of allow a carry on and a personal item policy. We chose the United flight because it got us back at a decent hour so we could make the 3.5-hour drive back to our home in Idaho. We had tried to print our boarding passes online with the shipâ€™s computer/printer but were unable to with the directive we would have to see an agent at the airport. We were informed, when were arrived at the airport, that we would have to check our carry on bags because of the nature of the ticket we purchased. We weren't happy about it but did so at the extra cost of $25 a bag. We had purchased a basic economy flight ticket so that did not allow a carry on. We were placed in the very back row 38 and had a bumpy and straight-backed ride for over 6 hours. Fair enough. On arriving at San Francisco for our transfer flight of an hour and a half to SLC we had something to eat and waited. We were the last passengers to board the plane. As we were being checked in the United Agent stopped my wife. He/she said the carry on bag of my wife needed to be checked even though we had just gotten off a United jet of the same size and model so there was no question that it fit under the seat and that is the criteria that was listed by Expedia and United: â€œCarry-on bags are limited to one personal item that fits under the seat in front of you.â€\\x9d I have to interject here that my wife has used this same personal carry on bag for over 20 years of flying with all the major airlines United, Delta, American, Alaskan, and Frontier. No airline agent of flight attendant had ever given her a problem because of its size or dimensions (9x9x18). It always fit easily under the seat, even with the small computer planes that have much shorter routes with much smaller jets. My wife was forced to give up her personal bag before she could board the flight. My wife sent me on to board since my protests were falling on deaf ears. But after taking about 10 steps I turned around and went back to ask the agent if this had anything to do with the ticket we had purchased through Expedia? She/he said yes. So I went to board. My wife boarded about 3-5 minutes later and when she reached our back seats she was seething. She told me to guess what they had charged her to check her personal bag. I guessed $25? No. $50? No. She was charged $175.00! She told me she had felt bullied and belittled by what took place. This whole experience has soured us both towards flying with United Airlines. We have frequent flyer numbers with the airlines and this incident was completely out of character for the airlines that tout the â€œFriendly Skiesâ€\\x9d. It was illogical and unprofessional to treat loyal customers in that way.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Dublin. Most unfriendly staff ever. We are a family of 3 flying with a 3 year old, the flight is early in the morning, so we had toddler, who was sleep deprived and we had separate seats with my husband. We asked at the gate to help us to seat together, explaining that itâ€™s easier to handle our son together, but nobody bothered, basically, we were told, thatâ€™s our issue. In the plane my son has tantrum with crying, we tried to talk to other passengers, asking if there is a way to switch, no luck. Flight attendants just pass by saying â€œYou are his mom, deal with itâ€\\x9d, threatening to stop the plane taking off if I couldnâ€™t have him seated. My explanation that I need at least my husbandâ€™s help or the window seat (preferably the second) are ignored. Finally, there is one very nice flight attendant (the only one who seems to care about passengers) who was able to switch us to the window seats, we calmed down our son and he fell asleep. Other flight attendants gave us really bad attitude, as if being a parent means to have a magic wand that will make a 3-year old behave like an adult and quietly sit through the 7-hour flight. In addition, there was no child meal that I ordered, and he refused to eat whatever they offered for adults (the food looked awful), so he had only muffin and a couple of cookies during the entire flight. Most family unfriendly airline, worst flight ever.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Peoria to Ft. Lauderdale via Chicago. The actual flight was fine and the staff was friendly but watching the crew literally toss the luggage on the assembly line to be put on the plane really annoyed me. Thankfully my suitcase has a hard outer shell, but more care should be taken with paying customersâ€™ luggage.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Corpus Christi to Houston. Extremely rude flight attendant. I expressed that I had a very short time to make my connecting flight and she just said to leave my baggage outside the plane. You are allowed 1 carry on and 1 personal item. Both of my bags are not in my possession. I believe that United as a whole is a failure and needs to revamp the customer service they use to have. I am extremely disappointed almost every time I fly with United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Houston. United is very unorganized and unaccommodating. We purchased two tickets at the same time and we are seated 17 rows apart! When we asked if there were any seats closer they had a quick now and asked us to move on. This airline seems to do little to show any shred of customer care. We will not be using this airline again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Miami. So if I spend first class money, I expect first class accommodations. Purchased two round trip tickets for my wife and I. Both flights were first class. The outbound flight had a wonderful and friendly staff. But I was incredibly disappointed in the food choices. A burger is not an attractive option for a first class meal. Especially one with just cheese as a topping, and no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything. Plus I donâ€™t eat meat, so I was thoroughly disappointed. Worse was the return flight. The seat, tray table and armrest was absolutely filthy. I did not feel comfortable sitting in the seat. It looked like it hadnâ€™t been cleaned in days. Old food crumbs, hair, dust was prevalent. Could not believe United let this happen. I worked my way up in life to enjoy luxury. This ainâ€™t luxury. Iâ€™d rather spend my hard earned money with another airline for real first class.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Amsterdam via Washington-Dulles. We will never fly United again. Due to a mechanical failure, we were asked to get off our flight from IAD-AMS after an hour on the tarmac. We were then asked to check back at the gate in an hour for a status update, at which point they told us to check back in another two and a half hours, though they were already pulling our bags off the plane. It was obvious the flight was not going to take off, but we were strung along for three hours. When it was finally cancelled, we were asked to walk a half a mile from service desk at D15 to C20. Once there we waited for yet another hour in line. Here is where it got absurdâ€¦At the desk the United Service Rep printed out a hotel and 6 meal vouchers for us. While they are printing, our Rep and the other customer service reps were looking at the vouchers and talking about the fact they just said \"invoice\" on them next to payment method and how that was not normal. The manager comes out and tells them that \"it will be fine and just keep printing them.\" The Rep hands the vouchers to us and away we go. We wait in line for the shuttle then wait in line for the Westin service desk only to find out the vouchers do not work since there is no credit card associated with them or no established account with the Westin!!! After waiting to get on the phone with one of the United service reps at Dulles, the rep tells us we must go back to the airport to pick up a new voucher with a number! Fortunately Westin knows how to provide Customer service and convinces the United Rep at Dulles to just send over some form via email and puts us up even without a payment method. This negotiation lasted two hours. At this point we have been traveling for 11 hours with only 1 hour in flight. Also none of our food vouchers work at the hotel for the same reason. The next morning we find out the United has not yet sent the form over or paid Westin for our stay. This is the third United flight I have taken in the last 2 months that has either been overbooked or cancel by mechanical failure. United flights are unreliable and their customer service is appalling. All they do is pass the blame and never resolve the issues they have caused. I urge you to not fly them and hopefully one day their awful customer service will put them out of business.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Detroit to Richmond. I fly monthly for my business and have experience with multiple airlines - United is the worst! Flew from Detroit to Richmond VA with an 1.5 hour layover in Washington Dulles. Landed in Washington only to be told there was a 5 hour delay on my flight to Richmond. Considering that I needed to get to Richmond early, I asked if there were any other options. Spoke with multiple United employees and their response was to drive the rest of the way. I had no choice, so I decided to rent a car. Then I was told they would not get my luggage off the plane, even considering the plane was going to be there for 5 hours. After speaking to multiple employees, I luckily found one that retrieved my bag. Now on my return, i drive to Richmond airport and then receive a text telling my that my flight from Richmond to Washington Dulles is delayed 3 hours and I would not make my flight back to Detroit. Luckily I had not returned my rental car yet, I park and go in to speak to an agent. Once again, nothing they can do. I have to switch my rental location back to Washington Dulles and drive there as fast as I can to make my flight back home. No options offered, no offer to cover my rental cost, nothing - dont fly United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Kalispell to Raleigh via Denver. I bought three airline tickets in January for our trip in March. On both our flights to NC and returning to MT we were spread out between multiple rows and not able to sit together. In addition we were all in the middle seats of the various rows. It makes no sense to me why a family of 3 traveling together cannot sit together. I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I scheduled a round trip from Ontario to San Francisco. I was told my flight was cancelled due to weather condition at the counter when I was trying to check, and they said they sent me a text, which I received during my check in. I asked the lady who works at the Untied Counter, what are the alternative since the flight is cancelled, she told me I can take another flight which is about 2 hours away (Burbank CA), or come back tomorrow, I asked her how do I get to Burbank, she told me \"I don\\'t know, I don\\'t deal with transportation.\" Then I asked her \"Am I going to get reimbursement?\" she replied: \"I only check you in, I don\\'t know about reimbursement, you should call United.\" I was on a business trip and my schedule was tight, and as I insist on a solution, at the next counter, China Airline\\'s employee felt bad and helped me to found a solution to fly from the same airport going to San Francisco. As I was waiting for my flight, I tried to contact United, I was trying to get an idea of the situation of my reimbursement, and was on queries for 2 hours, until I got on the plane. On the way back, as I got to the counter for check in, United Airline employee told me that my flight was cancelled because they put me on the Burbank flight (without my approval) and since I did not show up on the flight, they cancelled my round trip. They said they tried to contact me and maybe because I was in the sky when they called, but since I didn\\'t call them back, I am liable for this result. At the counter I just wanted to go home and told them I just want to buy a ticket now (I already told my friends when to pick me up, and unlike United, I don\\'t want to change what was schedule.) And the lady was like you can buy it with your phone. I insisted on her booking the ticket for me (I didnâ€™t want to have the risk of, where I brought a ticket online and the counter told me they can\\'t find it) then she tried to book me for about 10 minutes and told me \"I am going to have to stop booking for you since you are about to past the 30 minutes limit to board the flight.\" And Later on I found out the person who is \"more\" familiar with the ticketing was on lunch. The most disgusting part is their attitude and the situation they put you in, \"I am not responsible for your schedule.\" \"You didn\\'t show up for your flight,\" \"I am not in charge of reimbursement,\" \"you should have booked your ticket online.\" Never ever United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Bozeman to Tampa via Houston. United Airlines has to be by far the worst airline ever.  They nickel and dime you for everything and then do not provide what you paid for.  Every employee/representative states\"there\\'s nothing I could do (for their own mistake and situation they have created).  Paid extra per passenger to be able to pre-select my seats and guarantee that I would sit with my husband for our long flights (I have developed anxiety with flying).  Paid for my checked bags when booking my flights. I check in to my flight the evening before my flight,  since I do not bring a printer on vacation,  I chose electronic boarding passes.  All info was good, name, correct flight and bags. Once at the airport, an agent told me we had re-check in to get out luggage tags.  We insisted that we were already checked-in with luggage paid for.   She made us use the kiosk, and when I checked in, my name was changed to \\'Olivia\\'.  So now my boarding pass does not match my ID, and they were charging us again for bags I already paid for.  At the counter, a call was placed to United by the ticket agent about the name change.  The person at the other end of the phone stated that another agent had been in my record earlier that day.  That agent denied changing my record.  My name was corrected, a new boarding pass issued,  but no seat assigned.  When we got to the gate, they re-assigned me to s seat different than the one I had paid extra to select at booking, and I was no longer sitting with my husband.  We asked to get my seat back that was assigned to me 45 minutes earlier, but they could not because my original seat was given away. Once on the plane, the bitch who got the seat with my husband would not move.  I ended up in the aisle seat in the last row....by the bathrooms in a seat that does not recline. To top it off, instead of offering to help, the flight attendant told me she was going to escort me off the flight for being upset. United airlines charges over the top prices, charge for everything and do not provide service.  Staff is rude, not helpful and are trained to answer \"there is nothing I can do\".  The bottom line is:  I will take your money, not provided what you paid for, be unhelpful and rude to you.  Then, you are held hostage and threatened to be taken off your flight when you let then know you want what you paid for. United -Tampa to Bozeman MT: $1500 for 2.  Extra charge for seat selection and bags. Delta- Tampa to SLC: $700 for 2. Extra charge for seat selection and luggage. American - Tampa to Syracuse: $490  for 2.  No extra charge for seat selection. United Airlines is a rip-off with very poor accountability and customer service.  Will pay more with another airline next time.  Very disappointed and United will not fix this. I feel like I was robbed. They do not care about the paying customer once you have given them your money. We will never fly with them again. Flight attendants are unhappy and rude, do not assist for anything. Ticket agents are incompetent and stressed.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Boise. I was scheduled for a flight with United Airlines on 3/20/2018. However, the flight was cancelled due to weather condition (which is understandable), but be reminded that United Airlines do not offer any compensation for weather-related cancellations. Not even a meal for >24hr delay. I got onto another United flight the following day, and arrived with a damaged luggage. The baggage service at the airport was not willing to do anything about it, but then mentioned that they will send the bag to a 3rd party in Texas for repair, and I will be contacted by the 3rd party. Two days later, I received a call from United to pick-up my bag at the airport and it never went for a repair. Nothing happened. But it is United, do not expect any customer service whatsoever. United has written rules and fine prints to protect themselves from paying compensation to passengers in all situations, so understand that you are handing over your money without any guarantee of basic service or protection in return. Again, avoid United Airlines at all cost -and remember this for many years to come (it was my mistake to forget past incidents with United many years ago and gave them another chance). A few hundred dollars spent on flight ticket may end up costing you over >$1000 in incurred costs during delays, lost time, as well as damages to your property.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Mexico City to Newark. What happened to being treated with courtesy and a smile. I struggled to get to the airport for a 5:30 am flight and they eagerly switched to a more direct flight, â€œthey were doing me a favorâ€\\x9d. It meant I had to be at the Mexican airport 3 hours longer and my wait in Newark was going to be 5 hours and I know they were looking to free up seats on the flight I was on originally. I also had an exit isle seat on the flight I was moved from. It would have been all fine if someone just said \"thank you for being flexible and helping us outâ€\\x9d but instead they tried to make it sound like they were doing me a favor. Further annoyed by the unfriendly 2 female attendants for the flight. Simply just not friendly.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Manila to Colorado Springs via Guam / Honolulu. Worst flights I have ever experienced. Flight to Guam, we were seated and asked the flight attendant if he could put my wife\\'s purse in bin above us, he gave me a dirty look and shut the bin. I asked him again and he finally took it acting as if it was an issue for him. The flight from Honolulu to Denver was horrible, the seats are too narrow. When we boarded we were in 17D and 17E. When I went to put my one carry on bag in the bins above my seat they were full, and the flight attendant gave me a dirty look and said to put it in a bin behind me. This meant I had to put it about 7 rows behind me. The result was when we landed, I had to wait for everyone to leave plane before I got to get my carry on. The reason the bin above me was full was the flight attendant allowed the couple to our left to use two bins for their carry on baggage. When I pay for a ticket I expect to be able to stow at least one carry on above me in the bin. My opinion was the flight attendant could not care less. The other problem is the seats are about 17\" wide and have little recline. I think the management at United needs to try flying and sitting in one of these seats for a 7 hour flight and see how they like it. Overall the service and seating was horrible. If you fly to Asia, I would recommend JAL or ANA as they have great seats and service, plus they provide an excellent meal.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Horrible again, missed out on a day again. This trip we sat on the tarmac for 35 minutes because they had no where to park the plane. Missed the last flight and had to spend a whole day in Denver till the following night. After all of that expense we return the next day to find out they have no crew for that flight. So here we sit again. June 2017 they bumped our seats and we missed our own wedding. We donâ€™t care anymore about price. We are going to take our business else where from now on. They are a ridiculous bunch of slackers. In one year we have missed our own wedding In Kauai. And now our granddaughters first birthday. Atrocious I say. Shame on you taking peopleâ€™s hard earned money on promises you cannot keep. United has no accountability for practices that inconvenience nice hard working people with no recourse besides never flying them again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to San Francisco. The worst airline from start to finish. Roof at bag tag, bag drop, entry to Security and on board. Absolutely terrible. It is after many flights that I waste my time writing a review.

Regarding entertainment: connectivity almost always minimal and they explain too many people are using it!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Panama City to Los Angeles via Houston, and quite disappointed with the in flight service. First, it was a 4 hour flight over lunch, and international. However snacks (except for one tiny bag of pretzels) and meals were only available for purchase at high prices. Maybe Iâ€™m just conditioned to the high standards of Delta and American and expect to have at least a substantial snack on any flight longer than three hours. Additionally, in flight entertainment was not free, but my monitor was not working anyways. Finally, seat comfort is not great. The head rest pushes ones head forward and makes sitting for 4 hours quite uncomfortable. Overall, Iâ€™m not impressed. While the staff was very friendly and helpful which I very much appreciate, i will try to avoid this airline in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Washington DC. Worst flight Iâ€™ve ever been a part of in years of traveling. We boarded at 7.30pm in Philadelphia and have been awaiting takeoff ever since. Itâ€™s currently 11.00pm. Not sure exactly on the wait but in the process we have refueled as well as de-ice for a second time. They did give us a sip of water. United sucks and everyone I knew flying delta and America tonight made it on time with no issues. I will never fly again. Thanks for the service, could have just planned to stay another night in Philly but no transparency.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew from SFO to IAD and tried to book for the economy plus but the only seats available were the middle seats. However the normal economy seats were actually OK. The inflight entertainment were good, however the internet was the biggest problem. I bought internet for the entire flight however due to connectivity issues, I got disconnected. I bought another internet packet for the entire flight and got disconnected for the second time. The flight attendant gave a United Airlines voucher worth 100 dollars (more than twice the value of the internet I bought). The flight attendants were helpful, friendly and humorous - not something I am used to in Asian airlines but I enjoyed it.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew economy class from DCA to JFK with the small plane which was fully booked. The seats are tight and the seat pitch is small. My 4 wheeler luggage could not fit into the overhead compartment (best to bring a small briefcase or backpack next time) and had to be put in the cargo hold. The process of taking the luggage was pretty unusual (we were not given any tags and had to queue out near the door cluttering the exit). The business class seem more spacious at it has a 1-2 config instead of the 2-2 in economy. The guy next to me was a pretty big size to the point I just didnt bother even putting my arm on the armrest. The service was pretty good in my opinion, polite but not out of the ordinary. Not a lot of airlines serve this route so I would have to recommend United Airlines!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Boston was extremely problematic. I had boarded the plane and was seated when a man said to the nearby flight attendant that someone was sitting in his seat. The attendant said to me, â€œI need to see your boarding passâ€\\x9d. Confused, I asked why. She said, â€œYouâ€™re in the wrong seatâ€\\x9d, in a rude and urgent tone. I explained to her that I would need to look through my emails to find my original boarding pass. She was rushing me, told me she needed to board all other passengers, and that I needed to hurry up even though she just told me to do this. I showed her my pass from the first leg of the flight. This made her even more on edge and provoked since it was not the right pass. I then found the pass for the current flight and showed it to her. She condescendingly asking, â€œAnd this is for the flight now?â€\\x9d, as she refused to read the pass for herself. I said yes and continued to point to the seats me and my friend were assigned listed on the pass. Without reading the pass at all she pointed to my seat and said, â€œYouâ€™re in the wrong seat. You need to move, youâ€™re in the wrong seatâ€\\x9d. She was unfriendly, unrelenting, and very angry at me. A man sitting at the window spoke up and said that he was actually in the wrong seat and it was his fault. The passenger that originally asked for help from to the flight attendant, was at this point, visibly uncomfortable by how the flight attendant was harassing nearby passengers and said it didnâ€™t matter where he sat he didnâ€™t care anymore. I ultimately was in the right seat the entire time. However, I was the only passenger the attendant interrogated rudely and angrily. She did not apologize and looked extremely annoyed after this all occurred. Scared that I would be kicked off the plane if I spoke up, I left without receiving any apology from her what so ever. I felt nervous, uncomfortable, upset, and victimized. Later in the flight, another attendant walked up to my seat. She yelled at me to put my seat fully up, two times in a row. I was shocked because I had never put my seat down in the first place. I looked up at her and she said this to me again while telling me to press the button to put the seat up. I pressed the button and the seat didnâ€™t move at all because it was always fully straight. I said to her, â€œIt is fully upâ€\\x9d. She said extremely shortly, â€œI am allowed to tell you to put it up. That is my job.â€\\x9d Then proceeded to glare at me. I said â€œthatâ€™s fineâ€\\x9d. And she rolled her eyes at me. She did not treat any other passengers on board like this except for me. I felt treated unfairly and felt like I could not speak up or Iâ€™d be dragged off the plane. In both instances, I cooperated, did nothing wrong in the first place and was severely harassed by multiple flight attendants on board. This was my first time flying with United Airlines and I would never go back. What a terrible end to a great vacation.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Punta Cana to Dallas DFW via Washington. I came from Punta Cana, spent an hour at immigration. When I got out of immigration, someone from United was waiting for me asking if Iâ€™m going to DFW. I said yes. They checked my bag. Then, they changed the departure gate. I spent 10 minutes in the airport running to get to the new gate. When I finally get to the gate 10 minutes before departure, the flight attendant says that she canâ€™t let me in. I need to check with customer service. I go to customer service, they rebook me for the next day and do not provide me an hotel. When I fly with Delta, they always provide me hotel when itâ€™s their fault and I will spend the night. Also, we left from Punta Cana 15 minutes after departure because we were waiting for some customers. And, when we got to Washington, we waited 5-10 minutes before going to the gate. Thus, I lost in total 20-25 minutes because of the airline and they donâ€™t want to get me hotel saying itâ€™s not their fault I spent a long time at immigration. Meanwhile, I could have make my flight if I did not lose those 20 minutes. Thank you United. Iâ€™m not gonna flight with you anymore! I am really upset.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United Airlines from Los Angeles to Orlando. First of all, they were late boarding and the flight left late. No explanation provided. They said active military could board first. My daughter had her military ID out. Everything was fine until another lady approached and said are you all together and she said our bags could not go on. I have flown all over the world with my family and these bags. Never have I been told that I could not take my carry on aboard because of the size. She was rude and nasty and didnâ€™t care what I said. Nice way to treat the military and family United. Will never fly your airline again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | So disappointed! I upgraded at the counter to a Premium Economy seat, for the price of USD 115, as I knew I would be landing with jetlag, and needed to reach my next connection out of Amsterdam. Other than the 10 cm extra leg room, it was a waste of money. Not even a free GT. I do not expect to get a gourmet meal onboard any flight, but the food here was not even worth waiting for. The bread was like a sponge, with a BBD far into 2019. Service was ok, but not more than the minimum requirement.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Atlanta. The worst airline I've ever flown. The employees were extremely rude and unfriendly. At the desk, when they charge you because they don't allow carry on bags, the employees do not want anything to do with you, except take your money for a bag that should be allowed as a carry on anyways. At the gate, when they assign you a seat, they don't even look at you. I guess it makes sense with an airline that creates class warfare in the main cabin of the plane. They have about three different classes of ticket for the passengers who are all sitting in the same section on the plane. And they treat those who has a Basic Economy ticket like farm animals. If not, worse. You have to pay wifi, pay if you want a tiny bag of food, pay to check a bag that should be carry on, and all while they not caring about you at all. They have older planes, the ones that other airlines retired years ago, so they're excessively cramped, and dirty, and little things on the seats and in the aisles are broken or falling all. They consistently oversell their flights, so you may be asked to give up your seat. Since their ticket prices aren't even cheaper than most, I'll be much more happy paying in the same price range to fly a different airline which allows a carry on bag, provides free wifi, allows you to pick your seat, and doesn't treat you like pond scum. United Airlines should be ashamed.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Albuquerque. I have not flown United Airlines in years. Decided to give them a chance as I found a cheap ticket. Flight was late taking off for no reason they could give us. We sat on the plane ready for take off an hour before leaving but they assured all of us going to ABQ would make our connecting flight. We landed get to the gate in SFO and they had just shut the door. There was 8 of us who they would not let on. When I called into customer care they would get us there till almost 24 hours later with a flight that would have another connection so who knows if we would have made that. I asked if there was a fight I could get on with another airline that would get me there that night as I needed to be. She looked and said no. I found one on AK Airlines and she said she couldnâ€™t book with them only American. I asked about getting a reimbursement on my ticket with United and she said as long as I didnâ€™t get on the next flight with them. Was on the phone waiting to talk to manager and I got hung up on. I purchase ticket with AK Airlines that can get me there that day. Call back as Iâ€™m walking to their gates. He only refunded me half the ticket since I used the other half. Stated I would have to email a complaint to get other part of ticket back. Well after months of emails and calling I have not received the other half back or anything towards that AK Airlines ticket. They say there is nothing they can do. All I was asking for was $35 dollars! Plus when I got to the AK Airlines gate United had put one lady on that flight so they could have done it. Long story short horrible customer service with no results except a $50 off my next flight with them. I will never fly them again so told them Iâ€™m not interested in that!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My trip with United from Chicago to Bozeman has been all around bad. Not only do they charge you for any bag you try to ship, I arrived two hours early to the airport and I was still almost late because of the undermanned and under-enthusiastic staff as I tried to ship my bag. To top it off, I was confronted about my seating on what amounted to be a half-full flight and forced to sit in the back even with empty seats around. Disgraceful. I understand it was not the seat I had bought, but with so few people on the plane, I was astonished to be asked to move.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Honolulu to Chicago O'Hare. I was stuck on an 8 hour flight kept just above freezing temperature. Flight crew passed out more blankets but my toes were frozen, men were wearing hats and coats. I shivered for six out of eight hours on the flight and twelve hours after that. Never again. They offered me a glass of ice water mid flight and I suggested a space heater. That's the last time they interacted with me. The United airlines app that lets you watch free shows and movies does not work on Android. When I complained about the cabin being kept so cold they offered me a $100 voucher toward another flight. I told them to keep it.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Frankfurt via Atlanta. Traveling for Spring Break with my family. Got delayed first day and rebooked on next day and cancelled next day. We couldnâ€™t leave Houston for 2 consecutive days. We had to cancel our travel. Thank you United, never use them again. Domestically Southwest are much better, internationally much better to rely on Lufthansa, Air France, KLM. United is just unreliable and canâ€™t manage its fleet.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My husband and I flew from Newark to Las Vegas. We purchased the tickets a few months before the flight and I was advised to contact United to inform them of my pet allergies. I called 10 days before the flight and was told that there were no animals booked for either direction. I was then told to call back 24 hours prior to the flight as there were a few available seats and the pet policy requires 48 hour prior notification. I called back and was offered a seat in the pet-free area (for $200 more each direction) which I declined as there were no pets booked and we were in the home stretch, the 48 hour notification deadline. I was told to notify the gate agent on arrival. At the airport my bag was pulled for inspection as they x-rayed my book and did a thorough check on my EpiPen. When we finally arrived I let the agent at the gate know about my allergies and was informed that he didnâ€™t know if there were any animals on the flight. He told me that it was policy to book anyone with allergies on the next available flight if there were pets onboard. I asked if the next flight had any pets booked as my husband tried desperately to pull me away from the counter but, not before I heard the agent reply that he didnâ€™t know. He did know that my husband and I would be seated in separate rows, 15 rows difference to be exact. As we boarded, our carry on was removed and banished to the bowels of the plane. I said farewell to my luggage and husband, got seated, cracked my book, and took a deep breath. Thatâ€™s when I began giving my seat mate some serious side-eye to see if she was covered in cat hair as I scratched at my hives and waved away pet fur. I took 2 Benadryl and started hitting the bottle, of eye drops that is. Hour fours, two more Benadryl (thatâ€™s four if youâ€™re counting) and a full bladder. I stood up to use the restroom and peered over the seat directly in front of me and thatâ€™s when I see it. A stressed out, full shed-mode, Pomeranian sitting on his owners lap. He pants as his owner strokes his fur creating the snow globe from hell. Who knew sitting 15 rows away from your husband would come in handy. I passed the baton (bottle of pills and tissues cause heâ€™s allergic to dogs too) and ran to the critter free zone. To be fair, I am an animal lover but, the pet policies have to be addressed. Iâ€™m not the only allergy sufferer and youâ€™ll have a hard time convincing me that this particular dog was a seeing eye dog, a seizure dog, a PTSD pooch or anything but the fluffy family pet. I followed the airlines rules and look where it got me, the run around, and a trip to urgent care for a sinus infection. Oh yeah, crazy small seats, no WiFi, piss poor customer service! Taking JetBlue to Aruba this month. No more United flights for me.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United from Chicago to Beijing. Lacking customer service skills. The $150 upgrade was only so I could get a window seat. All of the regular economy seats were only offering middle seats. They take up half of the economy cabin with upgrades, so if you buy a late ticket, you have to upgrade to get a decent seat. Flight attendants were rude (both flights), and the food was awful. I normally have such great experiences with international flights, especially with Delta. This was beyond disappointing.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I have been flying a minimum of 3x a year for the last 25 years.

When I went to do online check in 24 hours prior to flight, I learned I had to check my small suitcase, that I have always carried on before. I travel very light. One small carry on and one backpack. I was told I was not allowed the suitcase and had to check it and pay $25 each leg. Ridiculous. I then had to wait in baggage claim, which I never had to do before. Iâ€™ve decided I will not be flying United again for this very reason. This change in policy is taking you out of the market as compared to other airlines. People that travel light typically go economy, and they travel light to avoid delays like waiting in baggage claim.

Bad decision United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Booked flight 6 months ago. Our transferring flight to come home was pushed forward about 2 hours. Our flight lanes on schedule, as soon as we departed the plane I asked customer service if we were going to miss our flight. They immediately confirmed before going through customs or security. At this point we had already traveled for 21 consecutive hours, this additional delay increased our total travel time from 23 hours to 30 hours. Especially tough when traveling with an infant. I believe United was fully aware that we wouldnâ€™t be able to make our connecting flight but did not notify us because we would have canceled our tickets. On the other hand, if it would have lead to us staying in a hotel for 1-2 nights I believe United would have let us know. Basically they are only out to protest their bottom dollar and have no consideration for the inconvenience they caused. We declined the $50 travel voucher they offered and will not be using United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flying from Bozeman, MT to Maui, HI with a layover in SFO, the first flight said it was delayed by nearly an hour and a possibility of missing my next flight, however our flight from BZN made it just in time for myself and several other passengers to high tail it to the connecting flight to Maui (OGG). The gate was still open with passengers loading, the ticket agents said to see the gate attendant to myself and the other 2 folks who were also connecting(with a line of people there). After several minutes (and the gate was still open) the agent finally looked up my boarding pass and said they had actually sold my full fare first class ticket to someone else, because they thought our flight would be too late! The agent was very curt and rude, offered no compensation, he put me on the next flight 4+ hours later in a bad coach seat next to a screaming baby with no food service on an evening 5.5 hr flight! That flight by the way also did not take off on-time as we sat on the aircraft for another 50 extra min making it a nearly 7 hr flight time. not the first terrible flight on United either.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Sydney to Cancun via Houston. Within 2 hours of take off was told there was no red wine left, with 13 hrs still to fly, we had had two glasses of red wine each. Staff were non existent, didnâ€™t come when the Call light was serviced, and when did appear were very rude as we had clearly interrupted them. Overall cleanliness and condition of plane was disgraceful and we were apparently on a new Boeing 787.

Our flight was suppose to be at 11am but was delayed until 3:30 because of a â€œtechnical issueâ€\\x9d. Shockingly there was no mechanic at this airport to fix the issue so one had to come from Orlando which took 4hrs. Older people who were waiting for news in wheelchairs were treated with disregard. New people were put on this plane by the airline only to face this grueling experience. Finally, after almost 5hrs of waiting, the flight was cancelled. Completely disgusted with the unprofessionalism and lack of care that took place. Will never fly United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Des Moines. This once mediocre airline has slumped even further down in their level of customer care. They have taken away the option to check in online from passengers that don't carry additional luggage. Customers with only a personal item must now check-in in person. What a way to increase efficiency and wait lines. I now get to spend more time away from my personal life and at their terrible terminals. This airline is a waste of space and the same attitude that ended with a customer being beat up with on a flight clearly seeps into all manners of their customer interactions.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Washington, D.C. to Cleveland. United forced me to check my suit and charged me $50 for it knowing full well that it fits in very tight spaces. Their baggage policy also almost made me miss my flight since they dont allow online check-in if you say you are not checking any bags. In other words they are going to squeeze you to the point of missing your flight in order to get that extra baggage fee. Well, they just lost my future business. Goodbye and good riddance United. I will even pay extra to avoid United next time.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to Newark. I went against my better judgement in booking a round trip flight with them. This airline has by far the worst customer service I have encountered. They lack customer support and assistance when it comes to dealing with flight changes and cancellations over the phone. The representative I spoke with canceled my flight without confirmation and prevented me from flying out to my destination on time. In addition I had to book a flight for double the amount of money out of another airport and United provided no compensation or refund for my inconvenience.

They used the excuse they didn't have enough runners to board the plane fast enough? Get real people. United Airlines petsafe department sucks. I paid a lot of money for this dog and I still don't have it in my possession. On a side note, United Airlines customer service is even worse. The employees didn't have a care in the world. Heartless, non sympathetic and very rude!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Original flight canceled due to weather. Understanding this creates havoc. App was good at sending message, but contacting a human to see what options were took over an hour on hold. Re booking direct flight was not possible. Our diversion through Houston worked out OK, but staff along the way were extremely rude and the treatment of basic economy class passenger is like they are dirt. I read and tried to follow the luggage rules. I paid $50 for the privledge of checking two bags. My wife and I consolidated into one small carry-on bag. I was among the last group to board, with everyone else carrying much larger bags aboard when a gate agent yelled at me to stop and demand I pay a $50 dollar fee to gate check. When I told her I had paid the fee online for two bags, she \"let me go with a warning\" but told me to leave bag unattended at the gate (which I refused to do) this is against every announcement and safety procedure airports have. I took it with me to the plane, and asked a stewardess if I should check it at the door. She was friendly, and I was allowed to leave luggage where at least an airline baggage handler took it directly and joked he would have it in New Orleans before I got there. The plane was filthy, dirty tissues in the safety card pocket. Trash on the floor, wrappers and cellophane. PA system didn\\'t work. No internet on this flight (broken). The short hop flight from Houston to New Orleans was about as tight as they can make it (I\\'m 6\\'2\"). I find it hard to believe this passes the safety rules for evacuation speed, these seats are so close. The message from the airline is clear - if you opt for basic economy, we will make your trip so bad. A fellow traveler joked he had more legroom in the toilet and was tempted to hide out sitting in there for the rest of flight. So, I tried to follow all the rules. I am a pretty easy going person, compliant with others. But this experience was pretty awful.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to New York. Don\\'t have much to say beyond what everyone has basically come to expect of United: minimal amenities, non-existent customer service, and generally quality suitable for a 3rd world country airline. On the flight they charge extra for everything, just like the low-cost airline that they are, with the exception of 1 drink and \"free entertainment\" if you bring your own device. Of course, they don\\'t provide a port for charging said device, and also don\\'t actually let you watch most of their entertainment unless you install some software, which on a Mac simply doesn\\'t work (it keeps asking for Flash even if you install it), and on a mobile device requires downloading their app, for which you need Wi-Fi, which, who\\'d have guessed, you have to pay for. As for the very limited selection of movies that don\\'t require said software, they still don\\'t work on a computer, but on a mobile device are just close enough to working that you\\'ll spend the majority of the flight (not remotely an exaggeration) staring at a frozen screen as it presumably buffers for 15-20 minutes at a time. I suppose the only thing setting this United flight apart is that this time we flew with their new \"Basic Economy\" concept, where for more or less the same price, they manage to exceed even their normal standards of how clear they can make their contempt for you as a passenger (to be honest, little difference beyond disallowing even carry-ons, but they do make sure to constantly remind you of it, which is especially egregious considering that\\'s something even the low-cost airlines allow).', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Kansas City. United Airlines was terrible from the moment we stepped foot in the airport. One employee would tell us that our bags would be fine to carry On, while another would tell us that we\\'d have to check them, just minutes before boarding when it was already too late. We ended up being stuck in San Francisco, CA and needed to just take the second leg of our trip instead of starting with Bakersfield to San Fran, San Fran to Kansas City because we ended up being stuck in San Fram due to a family emergency. We called customer service and explained the situation to which they replied that our entire flight would have to be cancelled due to a \"No show\" since we wouldn\\'t be on the bakersfield to San Fran flight. We explained the situation again and stated that we\\'d still be paying for the flight but just wouldn\\'t be on it. They eventually said that they got it taken care of and that we could take the San Fran to Kansas City flight and skip Bakersfield so we were under the impression that everything was taken care of. The next day (the day before the flight), we went to check in to our flights and were unable to do so on the United Airlines app on our phones. We called customer service again and were told that our flight was cancelled completely and that we were going to owe $380 each plus what we had already paid for our flights in order to get them reinstated due to \"fare changes\" and we would have to take the Bakersfield to San Fran connection again. We explained again that this was not possible and what we were told the day before about not having to take the bakersfield part of the flight and that we were told everything was taken care of. The customer service representative stated there was nothing they could do and that we\\'d have to pay the fee and take the connecting flight if we wanted to make it back to KC. When asked to speak with a manager we were placed on hold for almost 30 minutes and then they came back to tell us that it was a mistake on their end and we were able to take San Fran to KC with no additional charges. While on the San Fran flight the flight attendant was extremely rude. There was a line of people trying to board and she attempted to push past me to close one of the overhead compartments. I asked her if she could wait until we sat down and she said, \"I need to close these now! They\\'re full! Back up for a minute\" In a very brisk and rude manner. She was slamming the doors on the compartments and pushing past people. A couple minutes later when she seemed to be over her tirade, another gentleman on the plane asked her if she was having a rough day. She stated, \"I left something expensive on one of the other planes and they wouldn\\'t give it back.\" He said, \"I\\'m sorry to hear that I hope your day gets better.\" To which she then continued to go slam more of the overhead compartments and order the passengers around. My entire United Airlines experience has been awful and we will not be using them again. Terrible customer service is an understatement.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Ontario to Washington DC via San Francisco. I fly at least once a week both domestic and international.

Last time I took to DC, the canceled the return flight because of the crew. This time we were delayed about 45 mins.

I havenâ€™t flown United in over a year due to their constant delays and poor customer service. I decided to try them again as my company booked me on United. (For the past year I have made them re-book me on a different airline when they booked me on United). United does it again, I booked an aisle seat as I tend to get claustrophobic cramped against a window for any long flights. United changed my seat to a window. As usual their customer service was very poor. I donâ€™t understand why when you book a specific seat 2 weeks in advance that the choose to move a person to a worse seat.

I'm am at a loss of money because it was imperative that I be there. I will no longer suggest using United Airlines again!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | LaGuardia to Los Angeles via Houston. They will sell you flights with connections that you wonâ€™t make in time. Be real careful when booking with these people. They will make you wait until next day if you miss a flight and wonâ€™t offer you even a glass of water. The worst airline experience.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Miami. Pretty unimpressed. There was bad weather in San Francisco which is not their fault but they didnâ€™t put enough fuel in the plane and we had to land in Sacramento then fly to San Francisco. I missed all my connections and was given a new flight the next morning causing me to miss my connection in San Juan - a cost to me. I now have to sit and wait around an hour to get my bag (a carry on that I had to check because the flight was jammed full. I realize some things are out of there hands but they didnâ€™t offer anything to make my experience better, they have no connection to lounge access so canâ€™t even give you that to compensate or priority boarding for the inconvenience. Their best advice was file a claim online, and we all know how that goes. I think my days flying with United are over.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to San Francisco. Horrible customer service. My wife and I booked our tickets through expedia and we never were given the option to choose seats. At the airport, we asked them if they can do something about that. Instead of trying to help, the lady started cutting us off while we were talking and telling us that we need to pay more attention when booking tickets through expedia.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My husband just sent me a picture of him aboard his connection flight from Chicago to Cincinnati. His knees are forced into the crack of the 2 seats in front of him and the aisle. He cannot move. This was the same issue on his previous flight. How is this legal or safe? We will never fly United again unless seat spacing changes for the better. Sadly, many airlines now are shortening the space between seats to make more money. Absolutely awful.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Allentown via Newark. Have 4 hours delay, we are already in the plane so we canâ€™t leave the plane unless we decided to deplane and go again for the entire US and Canadian check. I missed my ride from Newark to Allentown and next available one is 19 hrs from now. I went to customer service and ask for compensation and they give me advice â€œto call a friend to pick me Up insteadâ€\\x9d. I tried calling United airlines customer service If I could get my refund and they told me it will be 7-10 days from now.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United has always let me down whenever I have flown with them. They are usually delayed and had me wait over two hours for a flight before. So when I was going home by them again I accepted that it wasnâ€™t going to be a fun trip. I didnâ€™t know it was going to be this bad. First off my flight started off late and the plane got to the airport 20 minutes later then we should have. They did not tell us why we were late though. Not only was it late but we had to wait longer than necessary to get our carry-on luggage that wouldnâ€™t fit on the actual plane. Due to all of this we missed our connecting flight. When we finally found the right gate (since it was switched on us at least twice) the flight had already boarded and the door closed. The attendant at the desk was rude and condenscending when she told us that it was closed and the plane left. We proceeded to wait in the customer service line for two hours in order to talk to a rep who didnâ€™t know anything and had to ask her supervisor on every little question. She tried to figure out why the flight was late but found no reason or explanation why. She said yes the flight was delayed but since there was no reason for it she could not get us a hotel room or even a discount on one. The next flight to South Dakota wasnâ€™t until ten the next morning which would have been too late for the event we needed to get to. We asked if we could be refunded and found a flight back to Tulsa. After a lengthy phone call they decided that they can only get us on the next flight back to Tulsa which was at 2pm the next day and if we want to be refunded we will have to call a number and jump through some more hoops even though itâ€™s the airlines fault for us missing our connecting. We asked if we could possibly fly back on Sunday. Since we were already in Denver we didnâ€™t want to shoot our entire weekend down the drain. She replied with a no due to policy. So here we are in the Denver airport at 10.30 at night with no luggage food or a room. We are missing a baptism. With how we were treated and hurt I am now going to make every effort to never fly United again. I will also never recommend this airline.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to New York with United, connecting to Avianca and Tam to Sao Paulo / Salvador. My partner and I won\\'t fly again with United Airlines. First of all, they started by \"forgetting\" to reimburse us a pair of tickets (worth more than 3000$), even after we called to make sure we had not been ticketed. When we had tried to purchase our ticket, they were not able to confirm to us our tickets within 24 hours, so their policy was that our tickets would be canceled - we would not be charged. We took extra precautions by calling them to make sure we were not charged, and were reassured that we would not be charged. One month later we find out in our credit card statement that we had actually been charged. This is not a mistake of charging 10$ extra to costumers, it\\'s more than 3000$! Moreover, we had to wait about 2 weeks to get the full reimbursement once we called them. And lot\\'s of talking over the phone. Second, during our trip, we wanted to change the origin and date of one of our flights. However, when calling United Airlines during multiple days and talking to several agents, some would say we could not change the origin of our ticket. No where on the ticket does it say we cannot change the origin. Also, we spoke to about 5 agents who told us all kinds of different rules and policies (often contradictory) - all with the same end: they would not let us change one of our flights. They told us we had to \"stick to our initial route\" and there were not changes possible. The call center staff is unprofessional, scattered around the world and all saying different policies, rules, etc. We wasted so much time. As mentioned, we will never fly with them again, we feel scammed, they took our money and that\\'s it.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew San Francisco to Los Angeles. I booked so called \"Basic Economy\" which is a new way that United Airlines uses to trick and trap customers. Of course I ended up paying $50 for two carry-on bags for each of us (one of them is really small and just because it has 4 wheels). If this is the way they treat customers and make money now, they are digging their grave aggressively. Company like this is really badly managed and have no reputation whatsoever. UA is on my never-to-take again black list and I will warn all people I know to be careful to watch out for their tricks.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Los Angeles. Before my first flight departed, I expressed concern to a flight attendant, because there was only 16 minutes from when the flight landed until my next flight started boarding. She stated to me that we would probably be arriving early so there would be enough time for me and they could ask the passengers to remain seated letting me off the plane. Neither these things were true. I get to the gate at LAX three minutes passed when boarding was meant to end. It is isolated and not a single employee nor other passengers are around. I pace around looking for someone but the doors are shut. I rush back to a staffed customer service stand for answers. The woman I had the displeasure of talking to was in \"Customer Service.\" Can I have your last name? No. Do you have an employee identification number? I can\\'t give it to you. She calls my gate and discovers the employees were in the jetway. She then continues to bang away on her computer keyboard for several minutes. There was absolutely NO attempt to help me make my flight. She notifies me that the soonest I can leave is not until tomorrow afternoon. I tell that is not going to work for me. She does not care. That was that. What else can you do? Nothing. How else can I get there? You can drive. I openly express my frustration. About how I asked for help from the flight attendant, she does not care. I demand that there must be something else she can do and at this she picks up the phone to call security. She then says to me \"we\\'re done, you are not willing to listen, we\\'re done.\" And at this, refuses to help me and sends me away. I come back to her and said that I was going to need a hotel room for the night. She responds with, \"I am not helping you with anything.\" You are not going to get me a hotel? She uses this as an opportunity to lecture and chastise me about I should have listened to her and if I wouldn\\'t have left the terminal [to find a human being to help me] then I wouldn\\'t have missed my flight. I have a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder which I am medicated for. This employee caused me to go into a panic attack which I could not breathe and started to black out. I tried explaining to her I have an anxiety disorder to which she responded with, \"yeah I can tell.\" It was the most violating and humiliating thing anyone had ever said to me. How dare one of their employees mock a paying customer who expresses that her medical diagnosis is affecting her.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Minneapolis. My flight was supposed to go out at 1:12 PM then got delayed six different times. Finally boarded the plane at 3:15 and ended up sitting on the plane for 2.5 hours. I decided to deboard the plane having already missed a funeral that I was supposed to be at in Minneapolis that afternoon. Filed a claim to get my bags return to Denver international airport after having to check my carry-on bag due to overcrowding on the aircraft. Spoke to a woman at United customer service who assured me my bag will be back the following morning at 7 AM. Return to the airport after having to get a hotel that evening. Returned to the airport only to find out my bag had come back to DIA, then was sent back to Minneapolis. Had to wait six hours at the airport before my bag was returned.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Atlanta. Literally never again. I bought new baggage to accommodate their â€œbasic economyâ€\\x9d requirements to ensure I wouldnâ€™t have to pay their $25 handling fee + checked bag fee ($30 for my flight, itâ€™s different based on aircraft etc). From ATL to Houston, no problems - return from Houston to ATL though, they stopped me at the gate and said I couldnâ€™t take my bag onboard despite the blue they put on my bag at check in approving it for my ticket. I insisted they were wrong and they tried to argue. I was close to losing my temper and they just said â€œok maâ€™am go on,â€\\x9d as if they were just trying to appease me. Never acknowledged that my bag was the right dimension for my ticket. I went out of my way to follow their rules and was treated like I tried to get away with something. Iâ€™ll never use them again, and no one in my company will either. The ticket wasnâ€™t even economical.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Portland. United Airlines has one of the most asinine and exploitative reservation and ticketing practices of all the airlines. Breaking Economy into a Basic Economy removes half the options for passengers upfront, and further alienates them by requiring an in person Check In process at a kiosks if they have any bags at all. Their app literally will not let you check in online if you are basic economy, without charging you $25. I fly out of Denver so United represents 75% I can take and they know how to get you on flight selection, ticketing, check in.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Los Angeles to Chicago.

United is the worst airline for international travel. I honestly dont know where to start.

I intend on flying any other airline for all my travel personal or business moving forward. This airline digusts me.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Houston. Staff mistreated us while we were attempting to check in at the front desk. We walked up to the computer to start our check in process and got to the point at which we needed a United official to assist (since we were flying basic economy). It took the 5 ladies behind the desk about 15 minutes to make their way to us. This is remarkable knowing that only about 4 computers were in use and we had our hands raised/waving for 5 minutes. The employees ignored us until we waved at one while reaching over the counter. When the lady finally made her way over to us she took us to check the size of our backpacks in the personal item container. It was a tight fit but they could definitely fit. The lady began to explain that if we did not check our bags, they would charge us at the gate a higher fee. We have ridden basic economy on about 6 flights each (a total of 12 flights) and have never had an issue fitting our bags under the seats in front of us. This lady was saying \"they are going to grab you at the gate and make you pay $100.\" She then went on to record our information after approving us. We didn\\'t get charged, obviously, since our bags fit in the personal bag space. United has lost us as customers.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Appleton to Chicago via Houston. Not happy.

Meanwhile, they send an email saying the flight had been delayed due to a late crew member and the Feb 17 flight at 9pm has been postponed to Feb 18 at 2pm. Meanwhile they abandon the passengers, customer service desks were unattended until 6am and the stranded passengers were given water and pretzels for dinner.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Las Vegas to Chicago. Our flight attendant charged me $50 for complimentary carry on and was completely rude. Said to another customer while helping me I have Diamond and Platium customers to help. Completely rude to me and others. I paid the fees, swallowed the rudeness and went on my way. Just very disappointed in this service as this is a customer service world and with all the terrible publicity United has had you would think they would try harder. I hope others donâ€™t get this terrible no star service, but if thatâ€™s what United is going for.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | The worst service ever. I purchased a ticket from Seattle to Syracuse NY with one stop in Chicago to find out when I got to Chicago that the connection flight is delayed by four hours. No apologies at all. They just really donâ€™t care. Last month they cancelled my flight from Syracuse to Seattle going through Chicago causing me a full day delay and added hotel room and rental car cost for one additional day since they did not tell anyone about the cancellation until I got to the airport. Again they donâ€™t care and they refused to reimburse me for the extra night hotel room. I will never ever use this airline again. Avoid them at all costs.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This airline is ridiculous with their basic economy! Itâ€™s not even about no more carry-ons - itâ€™s about not being able to switch to a later flight during a family emergency. I was only flying from NYC to Rochester. I needed to change my return flight to a later date. The original ticket is $150 plus $50 in taxes - makes sense for a 45 minute flight. To change the ticket since itâ€™s â€œnon refundableâ€\\x9d - and technically Iâ€™m not getting a refund just changing my flight - is a $50 conversion fee and then a $200 fee to switch the ticket! So theyâ€™re not helping Iâ€™m just buying another, more expensive ticket. Ridiculous. Never flying United again!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | My United Airlines flight from Colorado Springs to Denver was at 6am and it got delayed 2 hours. Meanwhile, my flight was the only flight delayed. Then, we finally boarded 2 hours later and we pull out from the gate, and they stopped for â€œmaintenanceâ€\\x9d for a over an hour.

I was in Basic Economy and understood what that meant. When I tried to use the machine to check in I was unable to do so and referred to an agent. They checked that I only had a personal item and gave me a boarding pass marked as such. We had a tail wind and made up about 40 minutes flying time. Tea and coffee was free on the flight. I also was willing to be offloaded but they did not need the extra seat. A good flight all around and I will be flying United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Palm springs to Grand rapids via Denver. So after finally being deplaned because of maintenance problems, I have been re routed to a flight that takes off two hours later, has a four hour layover at my next stop and gets me home after midnight. I've been dropped from first class to economy. And when I asked if there was any sort of compensation for this mess they have created, I was told I can call customer services. I asked to be put on a different airline so I could arrive home sooner as I have to be in the OR at 7 am tomorrow and was told I couldn't. It is unbelievable how you are treated as a paying customer. Why would anyone ever fly? When asked why they couldn't have figured out these maintenance problems last night we were told that they don't check the plane until shortly before take off. It's unbelievable!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | About six hours into my 15 hour flight from Singapore to San Francisco I was attacked by bed bugs from the blanket used - I was traveling Polaris class. Bites all over my chest - took eight days for them to go away. Worst flight ever - contacted United to alert them to this problem. United offered $150 as a \"Goodwill Offer.\" My intent was to alert them to this problem so that no one would have to endure such a horrible experience. Found their offer to be a slap in the face. I declined the $150 offer which I consider to be \"Bad will.\"', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Dallas to Chicago. This may be the only airline in the world to treat a nervous 19 year old girl with the most rude and unapologetic attitude. This was my first time flying alone so yes, I was a bit nervous.

What a horrible company!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Newark. I was traveling today with my son (who was sleeping on the stroller) and husband. Before we enter immigration at the entrance we met these two ground officers(women) who are checking bording passes. The one who took our bording passes looked at asked us to tell our names by showing each bording pass. We did as she said. But she asked us to repeat it. But we don't know why. My husband repeat it again also said we have to catch the flight at 10.45pm So let us go. (It was almost 10.30) she looked at me and said step back and take off my tiny purse which was hanging my neck and shoulder. So i had to step back and take off my backpack my jackets to take my purse and put it inside. I was just couple steps away from immigration. I know she wanted to make us uncomfortable in front of everyone. We felt so helpless specialy when we had a sleeping baby with us. This made me so upset during whole flight. This is the first bad experience i ever had.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United Airlines is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. I was charged $400 for two tickets to be changed, was hung up on while on hold three times by customer service people, and was told to call a different number which was an automated attendant. Was finally after one hour told they would not apply the $137 credit of my original tickets to an upgrade. The seating space is torturous and the airline crew are rude.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Washington Dulles. I am very upset at this point. I was scheduled to leave Philadelphia going to Washington then connecting to Atl. Flight 6319 was an hour late getting to Philadelphia. Intead of boarding at 7:25pm to depart at 7:50pm. Flight arrived at 8:35pm and plane took off at 9:08pm. We arrived in Washington 9:55pm or close to that time. Flight attendants reassured everyone that their connecting flights were still on time we would be fine. When I got to the gate for my connecting flight it was closed. No other flights are leaving out tonight. So I have to sleep in the airport. Catch a morning flight to Atl. The purpose of the email is communications should have been had between 6319 plane and 6322 plane. 6322 never knew of our delays so they proceeded to leave on schedule. I feel like just changing my flight and me sit and sleep over night in an airport is very insensitive. Poor customer service. I fly often and will never fly with United again. I was on a flight once yrs ago and there were a group of people on an international flight. That airline waited for their flight to land because they understood that the plane delays should not effect the passengers. I fault the staff and pilot for lack of communication. Hopefully this will bring about some change.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew San Francisco to Tel Aviv. 787-800 at the Polaris first - Business seat 6B. United service is something I can't understand, they do the minimum during all flights. Right after takeoff most of the team disappear, during the long flight (15hr) I couldn't see air crew activity if you needed anything, the one at the galley was eating or reading emails. They forgot to give the amenity kit to 90% of the business class passengers, the plastic bags of blankets and water bottles left on my seat (at the seat upper storage area) were all over the flight and overall the Polaris that should be Business First is cozy and small for passenger above 185 cm with 2x2x2 configuration (meaning the window seat need to jump over you). Overall not a legacy airline at all, long way to go.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew San Francisco to Auckland with United Airlines. Check-in staff were unenthusiastic. Service at the United lounge was terrible. The male attendant at the reception desk had a bad attitude. Some of the flight attendants were lukewarm. Overall the attendants' service was nowhere near the Asian airlines, such as Singapore. Polaris business class is decent but still falls short of Singapore's quality. Onboard Wi-Fi was slow even when loading webpages, and they explicitly said streaming videos wasn't allowed. On airlines like China Eastern I could stream videos smoothly. Airlines like Singapore pay attention to every detail, such as the check-in staff. United falls short every here and there. After the mergers, United has monopolized tons of routes, so now they make money off of the monopoly and don't care about service quality whatsoever. Will not fly them other than on exclusive routes.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Grand Rapids to Newark. I had a bad feeling when I booked with United but as this was for a job interview and I was asked to fly out in three days, I didn\\'t have any other choice but to take whatever flights were available - my original sense of dread turned out to be justified and I certainly will not be flying with United again. The flight was scheduled to take off at 7:30 PM, it\\'s 9:38 PM and I\\'m still here. Initially, they announced a 3 hour delay, then, figuring that wasn\\'t inconvenient enough, they changed it to 4 hours. So instead of arriving at my destination at 9:30 PM as I was originally scheduled to do so, I will be getting in at 1:40 AM - no big deal. And of course the United employees at the kiosk make it quite clear through their laissez faire attitude, and at times downright rude behavior, that they really don\\'t care about the fact that paying customers are waiting out a 4 hour delay. It\\'s very obvious United doesn\\'t give any thought to customer service. When asked what the issue is, they respond with \"Oh, the plane is undergoing maintenance.\" Funny, I figured maintenance would be done routinely, not when it has the potential to ruin as many lives as possible. And, shouldn\\'t there maybe be a backup plan? Is every single United plane currently being used with no consideration given to the possibility of unforeseen mishaps like this? I especially like the response I received from the snooty United employee when I asked if there were any other flights available - \"No, probably not...\" Probably not? Umm, do you mind checking perhaps? Which she begrudgingly did after I asked. Real problem solvers they got there. I\\'m also really glad I signed up for both their email and text message alerts regarding flight changes. I received neither. I\\'m sure they just didn\\'t want to fill up my inbox or use up my monthly text message allowance. I suppose United figured this was the best way to earn back some respect. Nice job guys, this will certainly be my last flight with this airline. United has steadily been losing credibility amongst my circle of professional colleagues, and it\\'s not difficult to see why.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Washington. They have shrunk the width of the seats to such an extreme you feel crammed. There is literally no wiggle room and I'm not a large person. I feel sorry for the man next to me.

I was excited to try the Boeing 787 new Polaris at united. We had a nice welcome with the team and find my 6B seat The configuration is a bit tight- 2x2x2.

Worst service ever. Flight was delayed 3 hours and they switched the departure gate 3 times. All participating United Staff seemed thoroughly confused and did not know details about the flight. I would not recommend United to anyone of my friends or family at this point.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Everything was good with the flight, my issue was that they lost track of my baggage and I ended up receiving it 10 days later, they did not give me any compensation for the issue and every time I called them to ask for my baggage they were clueless to where they were and when they would arrive. Very disapointed because of this.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United Airlines from San Jose California to Houston Texas. I bought a ticket for my aunt who has Alzheimer's and bought her premium economy so she has more leg room and made sure she had an aisle seat to grab an attendant if she needed help. They moved her seat four times! Each time I had to call and say, she can not be put in economy, that is not what I paid for, and she can not be in a window seat! She has to be able to flag an attendant if she needs something! They tried putting her in a window seat, economy instead of premium economy, etc.. Dealing with a person that has Alzheimer's is bad enough, dealing with a horrible airline that I had to call several times to argue about why they cant move her seat is just horrible. They have notes in their system that she has this medical issue and I think they are trying to take advantage of that!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Worst flight experience of my life. Sat on the runway for two hours in Baltimore, so I missed my connecting flight in Newark to Norfolk. Was forced to spend the night in New Jersey, and the airline refused to give me a hotel voucher. I had to pay $100 for a hotel due to the airlines negligence. The customer service was incomprehensibly rude. It was as if they thought this was funny. I have never experienced an airline as terrible as United.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Honolulu to San Francisco. Our flights to and from Hawaii were great! Even though there was an issue with the WiFi they made sure everyone was able to log on quickly and gave iPads for those who couldnâ€™t log on. Also we ended up confusing our flight that was on Alaska and a similar flight and time was at United. When we realized this at the United help desk it was too late to get to our Alaska flight within seconds they put us on their flight and offered to move our bags to that flight as well. Also those German waffle cookie things are heaven.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Hong Kong via Newark. My flight BOS-EWR was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and I had a short connection in EWR to continue towards HKG. The customer service is unhelpful, as if the delay is your fault, not theirs. They refused to board me on an earlier flight, they could not offer re-routing nor sponsor the ticket with another airline to secure my journey. The delay was ultimately tight for my connection, but every UA representative I spoke to suggested the other flight would have likely waited. It did not. It left six minutes earlier than scheduled. Despite asking to the flight attendants while on flight whether my connection would have waited, the response was that United - differently from every other Star Alliance company - does not offer this \"service\". I landed and there was no representative to direct delayed passengers. I rushed to the gate to make the unpleasant discovery that my connection departed earlier. I thus went for the customer service. I stood on a line for 3h and 15m. Around 45 minutes after landing, a text message invited me to check-in for my next flight, from which I derived I was booked for the same flight the following day. After hours of waiting, I reached a representative that handed me a voucher for the hotel and US$ 30 for three meals: yes, $ 10 per meal. Not to mention, the hotel was sketchy and sub-standard. The flights were possibly the worst I have ever experienced in 14 years of flying. In over 16h flight (plus boarding, taxing, etc.) they serve two microscopic meals and one snack. No snacks in the galley. Never seen such misery. The crew was confrontational at all stages. They said: \"We are nice to people who are nice to us\", which is reasonable in abstract, but they seem to forget we are not fellow travellers! I am the customer, they are the flight attendants. As I have reached my final destination over 25h later than initially scheduled, I sought compensation from United. Unsurprisingly, their customer service is dismissive. I was told I can buy insurance next time. I do have insurance, but they cover unforeseeable events, not negligence of the carrier. I have been trying to hold them liable under the Montreal Convention, but so far all they offer are pointless vouchers in the illusion that I would ever subject myself again to the pain of dealing with such an unpleasant, unprofessional, unapologetic company. United airlines punishes you for making the unwise choice of traveling with them. Despite you pay for a service, they drop on you the cost of their inefficiency. Leaving aside old aircrafts, primitive forms of IFE that have disappeared in the rest of the world, broken controls, dirty and hard seats, meals that not even if you live out stamps. The point is the lack of consideration, the way they treat a paying customer at every stage of the experience, from check in to customer service when you try to claim damages for the disservice they caused you. Finally, UA cheats selling tickets with connecting time they cannot really respect or guarantee. They are cheating to rank higher on search engines with prices and journey duration. On any international flight, make sure you have 2.5h connecting time minimum. Few reviews will tell you UA is less worse than they say: don\\'t gamble with it. Choose better.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Oklahoma City. I have flown United twice now and both times were awful. They had an issue getting us checked in and because of that, we didn't get checked in before the 30 minute requirement on international flight so they wouldn't let us on our flight. Then on the way back, our flight was cancelled. Their customer service representatives do not care and are rude. Their flight attendants are rude. They do not care that your flight was cancelled and you need to get home because you have kids, work etc. They didn't even want to give us a food or beverage voucher. I will never use United again. It was a horrible experience!\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew New Orleans to David-Panama. On the website it said I could check in 2 bags. At the airport they said I could only check 1 bag. When I ask why they were rude, not wanting to help at all. They were unable to explain why, they start yelling and keep being rude. I will never fly with them again. I asked for a wheelchair because of a knee problem and they took forever to get somebody, I had to ask 4 times. They were rude again and told me I could start walking or wait until they had time to call the wheelchair person. If I paid for a service they should provide the service, not have a bad attitude with their clients. Not helpful at all. I wont fly with United Airlines again.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Chicago. United Economy Plus has a significant advantage in its legroom comparing to regular United Economy seats. A dedicated overhead compartment was provided for Economy Plus passengers, meaning I did not have to fight over someone for a space in order to accommodate my carry-on baggage. The seats were narrow, and were poorly padded. Only non-alcoholic drinks were provided free of charge, when alcoholic drinks and snacks were available for purchase. I have attempted to use the inflight entertainment, which did not work since it could not read any credit card in my wallet. I bought the inflight Wi-Fi. It did work and managed to provide a decent speed (fast enough for internet browsing and photo sharing apps). The cabin crew on my flight were nice, friendly and helpful. Overall, United Economy is a acceptable product for flights that are 4 hours or under. However if I am flying intercontinental, I would consider flying another carrier, since the same seat product is applied to all planes in UA's fleet.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | A complete disaster. First leg (Toronto to O'Hare) on Saturday had a lavatory problem - so we pushed back (got that on time departure) only to sit for a while and then return to the gate. But since it was an int'l flight we were not allowed off the plane and the CSR refused to get on the plane. Eventually left 99 minutes late even though FAA's MFR rules do not require a working lav. On return flight first leg (Omaha to Chicago) Sunday we arrived early but there our gate was occupied so we sat for an hour, even though you could see multiple empty gates at terminal. Connection flight was very tight and when we ran to the new gate we found it had left 10 minutes early. So much for that thing known as customer service. I am a frequent flyer (about 100 legs a year) and a Star Alliance Gold Member, but this is the last straw (United has messed me over before). American, Southwest, anyone but United when US travel is required. If there was a zero rating - that's what I would pick.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Memphis to Chicago. I have never given a bad review to anyone but the ground crew at this airline was beyond rude yesterday. Flying with one additional adult and two children (two and four years) and they expect that the kids can sit by themselves! The seats numbers were 7, 9, 10 and 20! Not only did they not help with the seating they were passing rude comments throughout \"Ma\\'am you\\'re making this more complicated than it already is.\" \"Didn\\'t you hear, I just made the announcement\". I heard \"no\" at least 10 times in 10 minutes. The lady was not only curt to me she responded very impolitely to the other passenger just requesting a seat. I am not flying United again if I can avoid it.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Absolute worst airline I've ever flown with. I had a bad experience with them in the past, but this was the only flight returning to Seattle from Fresno that I could find. Both flights (my flight to SFO, and the connecting flight from SFO to SEA) were delayed at least an hour, if not more. In SFO we were supposed to leave at 8.40pm, but were delayed. However, we still boarded even more passengers, and were told we would be taking off at 9.10pm. But, because we continued boarding we didn't leave the ground until after 9.30pm. No explanation was made by the captain or the flight crew, but there we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. The flight was hot and stuffy. I also was incredibly annoyed with the baggage policy. When I booked my flight, there was no communication that I couldn't bring a carry on bag. As this was a very short trip, I brought just a carry on and my personal item. But when I checked in, I was informed I couldn't have one and needed to have it checked, for an additional $25, and that I couldn't even check it at the gate. I've never in my life, been told this before. I literally had to rethink everything I packed and how I packed it, as I had a layover and needed to do homework. When I got to the United booth at FAT to drop off my now checked bag, there was no one there, and the other customer and I waited ten minutes for them to return, again with no explanations. The kicker was when I got to the gate and everyone who had a carry-on bags was given a tag (no additional charge) for their tagged bag! Coupled with so many other things that went wrong today, having a horrible flight experience was the worst thing that could have happened. So take heed, if you fly Basic Economy, you have to a) pay a $25 checked bag for an otherwise acceptable carry-on bag on any other airline, and b) if you fail to check the bag there is an additional $25 fee on top of the checked bag fee if you check it at the gate. Absolute swindle. You buy a cheap flight because you can afford it, but then you have to pay extra for something every other basic airline ticket allows you to have. If I can possibly avoid it, I will never fly with them again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United from Buenos Aires to Newark. Unfortunately this flight service was by far the worst I\\'ve ever had. Food in general is awful but when they came to my seat, the option would have been chicken or beef. The attendant said to me your option is only beef or beef. I looked at him like, what? He laughed and said sorry and my response was I\\'m sorry but I do not eat beef. His response was literally \"you can eat the stuff around the beef\". Mind you, I had seen a flight attendant come up and grab five chicken entrees before the serving was finished. I asked him if there was anyway to get chicken as I honestly don\\'t eat beef nevermind eating around what the plate had. It had nothing except powdered mashed potatoes. This was a ten hour flight, I wasn\\'t going to starve because of the lack of organization. In the end a flight attendant overheard how upset I was and they gave one of the ones they had taken. I know it is not the flight attendants fault at all but at least be respectful of others dietary needs. Our flight cost enough even on economy to provide us with better food services.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Auckland to San Francisco. I was traveling with my daughter and 5 year old grandson. The airline had changed our flight but did not give us the same seats, which had put us not flying together. We talked to the United person at the gate which he changed our seats and were very helpful in accommodating and put us together. Once on the plane for the 11hr flight home the flight attendants were very rude. At one point we were snapped at because we hadnâ€™t filled out the entry to the US card on time. I believe she screamed at us and said â€œyou had 11 hours to do this.â€\\x9d Never been on a flight with such a display of rudeness from flight attendants. Do not believe I will be using this airline in the future!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Portland. We were super disappointed with American Airlines. The problem was coming from Detroit to Chicago trying to connect to Portland. Our plane was a smidge late getting into Chicago but wasnâ€™t a big deal because we had an hour and a half between flights. We spent 1 hour driving around the airport. The other flight was behind and we didnâ€™t have a place to port. So we missed our connecting flight. We had to check bags in valet so we had to wait for that but they lost our bag. I But the lady was super rude and told us it wasnâ€™t their fault and was convinced we never valet our bag. Even though I had the receipt and the claim voucher. When we asked the lady at the counter to call down and ask them to hold the connecting door for seriously only 3 or 4 minutes, she said no - we sprinted down there to find out that they closed the door early. We go to counter to get new flights, they were rude, and wouldnâ€™t comp any meals or hotel or anything. They booked us on a United flight that left 14 hours later. We went down to check in with United since we had a million hours to kill. United Airlines not only gave us food vouchers, they put us up on cots and gave us toiletries for free. They upgraded our seats, then had a person personally escort us to the United club so we could sleep for the night. They then tracked down our missing bag and paid to have it delivered to our house the same day we arrived home. Plus their WiFi worked in board. And they have really good cookies too. Basically United went above and beyond to accommodate when it wasnâ€™t even their fault. We were super super pleased by them and all their staff! Congrats United. You just earned yourselves lifetime customers!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | This has been one of the worst airlines Iâ€™ve ever flown in! Iâ€™ve taken this airline about four times because of how cheap it is letâ€™s just say the cheaper the ticket the absolute horrible service! I have missed my connecting flight four times because of delays! Last night I took united from Boston to Washington DC as soon as I got off the plane I ran for the next airplane which was taking me to NC when I arrived it said now boarding I asked him to open the door because technically I was on time and they refused they were super rude they yelled at me I am in the service so I need it to be back before certain time they refuse to let me talk to anyone else to get for their assistance I ended up having to take a vehicle and drive to North Carolina absolutely horrible I will never ever ever take this airplane ever again ! And Iâ€™ve never been refunded for missing my flights which I have nothing to do with', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Kahului to Chicago. I understand, you can not control the weather, but the people at the customer service you can. Ruth, offensive, unprofessional, unpleasant in Chicago O'Hare. I was upset, due to 12 hours delay, and tried to talk to them to find sooner connection to Toronto. You paid for your check in luggage, wait in Chicago for 7 hours and sure enough your bag is not deliver. None of the people from the flight from Maui to Chicago got their checked bags. Onboard nothing is offered. United you lost our business for sure.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Chicago Oâ€™Hare. The worst airline Iâ€™ve ever had to deal with. We knew we were getting sleet and ice since 3am. Waited on the runway for 2 hours to finally take off to Chicago and missed our flight from Chicago to Mexico. They state they will not pay for our stay since we leave tomorrow morning. Weather is out of your control. But being prepared for that weather is not. Will never fly with United after this trip.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Rochester via Chicago. It is surprising how incompetent a company can be. I called to have my return flight changed from 12-30 to 12-27 for a family emergency. The agent charged me $200. On 12/27, I went to check-in, realized my return flight hadn't been changed, and I called them. After sitting on hold for an hour and a half, the agent was extremely rude and told me she couldn't change my flight to that same day because the fare difference was too large. Since then I have sat on hold for a total of five hours, talked to several different agents who claimed they recorded the information and sent it along to the complaint department. I finally found out nothing had been recorded, so I submitted a complaint online. When someone finally reached me, she offered a $100 voucher. My original ticket was worth $400, they completely messed that up, were rude about it, and I sat on hold for hours to resolve the issue because of their lack of communication between departments. Now I'm left with half a ticket, leaving me no choice but to fly with these people again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Columbia. Delay after delay after delay. We heard of inclement weather happening on our return trip so we called the airline and paid to have our tickets changed to an earlier flight. Now, we are stuck at our connection and will be arriving home close to the same time we were originally scheduled after the inclement weather has already hit. A waste of time, a waste of money. We literally could have spent an entire day working in D.C. but because of the ineptitude of this airline we lost a full day. This happened on our flight out as well, delayed in Denver. It seems that United cannot be held accountable to their own schedule.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington Dulles to Hong Kong. Not a lot of choices to fly from Hong Kong to the US, Unfortunately, the cheapest was United. Due to the holiday season, the tickets were expensive so this was my only option. My first flight from DC to SF as delayed, and I had a connecting flight so I almost missed it, we stayed on the plane for 3 hours before takeoff. Whenever I asked the flight attendants about it, they were so rude and defensive and seemed unwilling to help me. The plane was so old and dirty and no leg room. The international flight from SF to HK was also delayed though not the airline's fault. I think the service and flight attendants on international flights are way better than the domestic ones. They had a good selection of movies, though the food was just average. Overall for the price I paid I say it wasn't worth it, and I wouldn't want to fly with United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Newark to Boston with United Airlines. The worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Every flight Iâ€™ve ever booked with this airline has been delayed due to a late aircraft and every United employee I have encountered has been rude and very unprofessional. Iâ€™m very disappointed.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | St. Louis to Brownsville via Houston. Delayed in St. Louis by an hour and that caused me to miss my flight in Houston. Customer Service had an attitude when trying to get the next flight to where I was going and they made me sit at Houston airport for 8 hours. Finally get to my plane after sitting in Houston for that long and I am standing in line and they had to apparently â€œdrain the lavatoryâ€\\x9d which then delayed that flight another 30 minutes. Over priced for the kind of service you receive. It is no wonder why Southwest does as well as it does. Avoid this airline at all costs.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Atlanta to Denver. After all the negative publicity United Airlines has received, I must call them out for giving me such a great experience! First off, the flight was delayed and I decided to get a snack from a vending machine. It got stuck. One of the pilots and a stewardess helped me get it out without me even asking. I hadn't noticed they were also waiting for the delayed flight. They helped us with our puppy getting used to the plane, and when I got sick, they came quickly with a sick-bag and a cup of ginger-ale. So, they showed me very good service, were very friendly, and went the extra mile.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Columbus to San Francisco via Denver. Don't fly United if you have a service animal. They put me in the middle seat with no where for my animal to sit or stand. So the entire flight she was forced in my lap. Every other airline is extremely accommodating, but United employees were unapologetic and just said next time upgrade pick your seat.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Newark to Seoul via San Francisco. I am a frequent flyer with United. They have my complete profile including food preference as vegetarian. However, they always starve me saying that I haven't notified the airline about my special meal. Crew are always rude and do not make any effort to provide me with suitable food. I am sure they have other food options suitable for vegetarians but they just get away with a sorry! I would never fly United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to London. The worst airline I have flown. Firstly for a flight of 7-8 hrs the Boeing 757 is a small plane with little or no leg space and cramped up passengers cos seats are 3-3. Thus each time I need to go to washroom both middle seat and isle seat passengers need to get out of their seats too which is really inconvenient to all passengers. Secondly there was no inflight entertainment despite the crew restarting the system several times which is outrageous for a long haul flight. Furthermore, there was no apology from crew until the flight landed in Heathrow where the crew finally apologised and said passengers to go online and get an appreciation voucher from United. This when I did that it gave me a USD100 discount code on any United Airlines with many conditions attached to it, unfortunately I wonâ€™t be flying United again at any cost, therefore even this voucher is of no use. On positive side I landed safely and food and drinks was ok for an international flight.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Newark to London Heathrow. United apply the recipe of discount airlines to long flight and this is not going well. Their organisation in Newark airport is chaotic. The entertainment system look like it's from the 90's (Ridiculously small screen and no possibility of movies selection). The inflight service is minimum and/or replaced by paying service. The food is well bellow any standard of what you can expect on a transatlantic flight.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Could have driven faster, came from Chicago to Aspen, Aspen to Bozeman but didn't make it to Bozeman until 4.5 hours later after stopping in Great Falls. so glad I woke up at 2am to get there after 2pm. To top it off, now our baggage is broken. Wonderful. Thank you for an awesome trip to remember.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Do not fly United. My husband and I flew round trip from Tulsa to Los Angeles with a connecting flight in Houston, TX. The trip there wasn't too bad other than the fact that they had t.v,s on the seat in front of you with direct t.v. and a remote control on the armrest. The problem was most of the remotes didn't work, and you couldn't change the channel. It was ridiculous. We didn't mind too much though, because we were more excited for our trip than concerned with our 4 hour flight stuck on one channel we didn't choose. The real problem came during our trip. We were supposed to fly back from LAX at 10 pm on December 31, 2017. We got an email late at night on the 29th, we didn't even see it until the morning of the 30th, saying our flight was changed. Just like that they changed our flight to 12:50am on the 30th. We lost basically a whole day that we had already planned out with relatives with basically no notice because they overbooked the flight. But we went anyway. At the airport almost 30 people were on standby for our flight. Then we were delayed over an hour. Then we flew to Houston, TX for a two hour layover. Then back on a plane to Tulsa. It made for a very long, very angry night. I'd pay an extra $150 a ticket or more before I'd ever fly United again. They do not care about their customers or our plans. This was a terrible experience.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to San Diego. So ridiculous and simply unprofessional. I have a connecting flight here in San Francisco, I arrived 4 hours before my connection leaves. I looked at a departures board and noticed another United flight left in just an hour. Went to the United customer service desk to see if I could switch. The woman at the counter didn\\'t have the decency to great me with a hello and before I even finished asking my question she told me there was nothing I could change at all. Her response was simply \"no changes\". I went to the gate and asked if there were seats available, the gate attended said \"possibly\" then looked at my ticket and informed the contract I signed when booking basic economy forbid me from changing flights. I asked \"even if there are empty seats on an earlier flight?\" And she said \"no changes can be made with this ticket if it were economy I might be able to do something\". I\\'m happy the gate employee at least explained my situation but this is ridiculous. United wanted to charge me another $35 for this trip to be economy. I paid $75 so that\\'s nearly a increase. I understand I bought a cheap ticket, that\\'s why I wasn\\'t even allowed a carry on bag. However, when there\\'s something as simple as putting a passenger, with no carry on or checked luggage, on the same size aircraft going to the same destination and United won\\'t do it. That\\'s ridiculous. It wouldn\\'t cost them a dime more but I wasn\\'t at the right paygrade for the company to care. Basically what I heard from United today was \"give me money and I\\'ll give a sh*t about you\". Needless to say, they won\\'t be getting my business in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Newark. United economy class was absolutely terrible. You cannot even take on a carry on, you must check your bag if you are in this class. My flight was cancelled due to inclement weather, and there was barely any flexibility in my flight change (had to be moved to the next day, but very limited in support), zero flexibility in allowing a carry on even though more time had been accrued, and very little acknowledgment of the difficulty that arises with a flight cancellation. I fly often, within the US and internationally. If I can help it, I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Due to fly United Airlines from Billings to Denver. Today is just another frustrating flight on United. 5.30pm flight already delayed until 8pm. Wont be suprised if flight gets cancelled. Last time I flew United I actually rented a car at midnight in Denver and drove 8 hours home rather than get stranded in Denver for 1.5 days with no hotel or any compensation. When I was flying from Pierre SD to Billings years ago they would often cancel flights for \"mechanical reasons\" and make you stay another day so they could fill planes. I try to avoid UAL, but they have a monopoly on some flights. Delta and NorthWest Airlines have always been excellent if possible. UAL is the worst!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United from Omaha to New York. My flight was cancelled due to weather in New York. When I called the call center to book a new flight I was told the wait time was 30 minutes. It's now been 1 hour and 20 minutes and I'm still on hold. This is ridiculous. I have to travel with my wife and two small children and the flight automatically re-booked for us is not conducive for a young family. I'm incredibly disappointed.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United Airlines is the most incompetent airline Iâ€™ve ever flown with. It started off as follows: we booked a flight from Montreal to San Francisco with a connecting flight in Newark. Upon arriving in San Francisco, we noticed that both mine and my husbandâ€™s luggage were nowhere to be found. They said that his was still in Newark and mine apparently was in San Francisco (at the airport). They couldnâ€™t locate my bag for 3 full days. We had to spend out of pocket for all kinds of clothes and toiletries (putting a major damper on our time in San Fran). They only delivered my husbands luggage two days later. To make matters worse, when locating where my luggage was, I told them that I would pick it up at the airport later in the day, as we had a wine tour in Napa scheduled. We passed by the airport later in the evening only to be told that my luggage was now on a flight to LA. Myself nor my husband ever told them to go ahead and do that! Their level of efficiency and service is extremely poor and I wouldnâ€™t ever recommend them to anyone. Unless you want serious unnecessary problems due to stupidity and lack of care, avoid this airline!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Diego to San Francisco. They made me shell $25 to check my bag that I've literally never had a problem with in overheads in dozens of times flying, even on smaller planes. I'm 90% sure they shrink the requirement test basket so people have to give them more money. United may often be the cheapest airlines but they will get the rest of the money out of you somehow. I feel bad for the people working the desk who have to deal with the faces of frustration from their horrible policies.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Orange County. Iâ€™m onboard now and waiting for departure, the doors are closed that means no one else is coming in right? I have three empty seats around me then I told to my sister to come and sit right next to us as they gave her a sit 10 rows behind off us. The attendant come to us and made her to move back to her seat saying that was not allowed to do that. What? The plane is half empty and my sister is sitting 10 rows behind off us with some strangers while we have empty seats right next to us. I guess no common sense. I guess they donâ€™t care about customer service. Last time traveling with United airlines.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Myrtle Beach. Once again, United Airlines has caused a problem. Not only did we have a nightmare experience on the out flight from MYR to Newark, the return flight experience was a nightmare as well. Resulting in my 2 children, who are flying together (17 years and 13 years old) to miss their flight. United Airlines allowed 2 minors to miss a flight. Even tho they were there when they needed to be. The check in process took so long, along with the security check thru process, that caused a major delay in there progress. Not only did they miss there flight, but now they have to wait until the following day, to experience this terror again. How is it that a major commercial airline, only has 1 flight a day. How is it that a multi billion dollar company, cannot take action, to get 2 minor children in a different flight. Instead, they make them travel back, a 2 hour travel, to do it again. First off, the \"Unaccompanied Minor\" charge is fraud. When booking these tickets, the website said nothing about added fees. The tickets were bought and paid for, and while attempting to do the check in process, United Airlines slams people with added fees. On the day of a flight. That is not ok. I get a voucher for our initial troubles (which We were under the assumption that could be used for the return flight fees) and got denied that as well. A $150 ticket, turned well over 400 dollars by the time this was said and done. Only for my children to miss a return flight, due to the faulty set up of United Airlines .', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | United made traveling during the holidays a nightmare. My husband and I flew out Christmas Eve and flew back New Years Eve and both experiences were terrible. Both had layovers in Chicago flying from Kalamazoo to Denver. The flight out got delayed 6 hours. We updated our connecting flight due to the delay and were supposed to have an hour in ORD before boarding our plane to DEN. However, our United flight spent half an hour searching for a gate causing us to almost miss our connecting flight. Additionally, our checked bag was lost and had to be delivered. It was also not delivered at the time it was promised. On our flight back, we got out of DEN fine, but arrived at ORD at 12 and with our connecting flight leaving at 3.45. Due to United's incompetence, we were stuck in the airport on NYE until 6.10 and did not make it home until hours after we were supposed to. It was 2 miserable days of traveling and United offered nothing to compensate for these errors that ruined our holidays. Do not fly United if you actually wish to get where you're going even remotely on time.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew from Chicago to Kalamazoo. I have been very disappointed by United on this trip. They had our flights booked several months in advance and now we have been delayed for 2.5 hours because we are awaiting an aircraft.

If you want to be even remotely guaranteed to fly at the scheduled time, do not fly United.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Jose to Cincinnati via Denver.

Due to weather delay, we had to reschedule flights to the next day. Three family members were traveling economy and needed to stay together for travel reasons after arriving to the home airport. The arrangement we were given conflicted with family plans so we tried to get on other flights. Two were given seats on specified flights, but I was told there were no seats available. There were many economy plus seats available and I suggested that I pay the extra fee for one of those seats. I was told that as an economy client, I didn\\'t qualify for the seat. I spoke to five different agents including a supervisor and always offered to pay the uncharge. I was refused. That night, I upgraded my current seat to economy plus. The next day, I asked another agent and she gave me seats on the flight with my family! Was she nice or did my upgrade then make me suitable for a placement on the flight. That is what I had been suggesting I do to all the agents. I am disgusted with United Airlines lack of concern for their \"economy\" travelers.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Tel Aviv. After a long time I was flying on United and only because my preferred carrier was not available on this route. I was very pleasantly surprised by both the flights departing on time and arriving ahead of schedule. The 3-4-3 seating layout made for cramped conditions. You really were in constant shoulder touch with one of your fellow passengers! Leg space is barely sufficient. The back of the seat did not recline noticeably. Thanks to being in the aisle seat, I could stretch out my right leg at times. Boarding at both airports were smoothly organized by boarding groups and overhead luggage space was ample. Individual flight entertainment systems were easy to use and they had a good collection of Hollywood, Bollywood, Asian and European movies. Beer and wine were complimentary. Two meals were served, portions were small. Lot of special meals -- kosher, Asian vegetarian, etc -- were delivered by frazzled flight attendants running up and down to match meals with passengers. The plan announcements in English and Hebrew were overly loud and frequent. The toilets were reasonably clean given the nearly 11 hours flight. There were snacks in the galley to pick on. Small bottles of water were available aplenty. All-in-all, a well-managed, though crowded flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Horrible customer service coming and going. Air Canada and United staff both unintelligent on how to service customers between the two causing delays sending me back and forth between counters six times causing me to not be allowed to board though the flight was not leaving for another hour.

I booked a flight with United 2 months ago and my flight was re-routed over month in advanced before the flight and yet United failed to inform me. So we showed up to the airport at 6:00am to find our original flight didnâ€™t exist and we were too late to board the new flight. The reason the flight didnâ€™t exist is because United stopped service with our connecting city of Houston for a few months, so we were re routed through Chicago. We then had to come back for a 4:00pm flight instead of the intended 7:00am flight. This we had to pay for an extra Uber trip to and from the airport, we missed our car rental and wasted hours of our day. The entire situation would have been avoided if United had simply informed us that the flight had been changed and made sure we knew! It is now a few days before our return flight and I called United customer service and they have no idea about the re-routing and flight changes. So I am unable I find out the information on our flight going back to Charleston. I am blown away that United is this incredibly disorganized. Not only did they change our flight and not tell us, but their systems donâ€™t even show when they no longer offer flights between two cities and their customer service had no idea that we were previously re-routed for that reason. Our current tickets still show flying through Houston on their end. Iâ€™m blown away by Unitedâ€™s incompetence. I definitely recommend staying away from them.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Seattle. On the way to Houston we were grounded for over an hour after we were supposed to take off from a mechanical problem (scary) but hey it happens can\\'t blame bad timing but on the way back after booking our tickets in a year in advance for a family of 5 for the return trip they ended up over booking the flight for the second time in a row (both coming and going to our destination). They ended up scrambling our seats so we had to sit at opposite sides of the plane. When I asked the lady why our seats had be switched she replied in the rudest tone possible told me \"if I would have just read the fine print we wouldn\\'t be having this conversation\" - if it wasn\\'t an airport I would have not just taken my seat. Absolutely rude and uncalled for, did not want to explain what was going on. It is what it is though I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone and will pay the extra $50 to fly Alaska from now on!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Tokyo. I will try to avoid using United Airlines if its not a last minute option. Being a 5'7 male doesn't help at all since the seat is very tight. Food was horrible. Rice and chicken were dry with low quality sauce. Mango sorbet tasted horrible. IFE on my seat didn't work properly while service was okay. Lots of friendly chat with fellow attendants while not so friendly with passengers its more like let me do my job and thats it. Cabin looked tired. Not much left to be desired, just the same horrible experience I had 6 years ago on a memorable 16 hours mind exhausting flight.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew from Denver to Minneapolis. Worst airline ever, rudest staff. Will never fly United Airlines again. They kept delaying my flight and every time it got delayed they gave us a different reasons. When we finally boarded in the middle of us boarding they told us to get off because the flight was canceled. Seriously, worst experience ever.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Helena. Awful, 4 cracked flights 18 hours of layovers - no compensation, hotel or refund. Sleeping on the floor on Christmas Eve in Denver with 77 other passengers! Worst airline ever! We were in the sky and pilot turning around due to no one receiving in the tower. Once re landed in origin we were told it was â€œweatherâ€\\x9d, no compensation would be given - â€œsorryâ€\\x9d next flight tomorrow at 1:45!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Austin to Baton Rouge via Houston. Outbound to Baton Rouge from Austin They tried to rip me off on baggage. I was told by reservations the laptop would not be a 3rd item. When I arrived to board the plane I was told I could not board with 3 bags. The laptop was a 3rd bag. Really? They finally allowed me to board. Inbound to Austin via Houston I thought I would need to check 3 bags. $25 for first, $35 for 2nd and $150 for third. Seriously? I was able to combine. Thank Goodness. Flight from Baton Rouge was delayed. The airline did not notify my connecting United flight so they could wait. Houston is a large airport. No courtesy. I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Pittsburgh. Frequent significant delays. We have been delayed several times with United- once for seven hours due to no plane, then no crew, then other issues- we had about 10 updates to our departure time, so terrible estimates. Major issues like not having a plane? Isnâ€™t this an airline company? Isnâ€™t that your entire business? A two hour delay seems pretty standard. Yes the flights are cheaper, but if you need or want to depart on time donâ€™t bother with United. Also, twice now the departure time has changed after booking before check in. We are seriously considering another airline since weâ€™re tired of spending hours at the airport.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Laramie to Denver. They overbooked the flight, took half an hour to de-ice the aircraft and I has to run across the airport to find my gate in time. I was late and now I'm standing in a mile long customer service line. Thanks for ruining my holiday break United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Diego to San Francisco. Terribly rude ticketing agent, lady didnâ€™t want to look up a flight herself, sent me to a kiosk to do what she was able to do without sending me to a kiosk. Her tone of voice was rude and not helpful. Ticket changing services for emergency situations are not permitted unless you pay an upgrade fee of $25 and then $200 flight ticket change and also the difference in ticket rate. I understand the policy, but emergency situations happen that we cannot foresee and have no reasonable way to change flight unless you pay ridiculous rates.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Kalispell to Denver. Rudest employees! None of them were friendly or helpful whatsoever. Iâ€™m pretty understanding of travel especially around the holidays but telling me that she canâ€™t answer my question right now because sheâ€™s â€œtoo busyâ€\\x9d is ridiculous. All I needed to know if the flight had been delayed any longer. I refuse to fly United Airlines again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Cleveland to Phoenix via Houston. Not only did we almost not make it on the flight due to overbooking, but we missed our connection due to late arrival. We were lied to over three times when we landed in Houston. The flight attendant told us we would make our connection so we ran there to find out the gate was closed before we even got off our first flight. Each person we talked to was very rude and blamed everything on the weather, holidays or us the consumer. I have never had a worst experience with customer service. This whole thing is horrible. The lady that gave us our flights for the next day gave us a discount for a hotel. Needless to say I didnâ€™t put a hotel stay in Houston in my budget. I will never fly United ever again and the only way they can make up for giving me the worst start to my vacation is a full refund. I didnâ€™t pay to have to starve in an airport for 6hrs while I wait to fly to Denver and then finally to my destination.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Chicago. United Airlines is another victim of less service for more money. What a horrible experience. Invented Basic Economy where I had to check my carry-on bag. First time in my life that I had to pay 25 dollars to check a carry on. The woman at the counter couldnâ€™t explain the new invention. Unpleasant, unexpected, disheartening, Unforgettable.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Sydney. This airline will get you from point A to point B but not much more. You can see a big difference between flying an airline like Emirates and then flying United. Their customer service is very poor. One male flight attendant from SFO-SYD clearly didn\\'t like his job at all. I asked for water because I wasn\\'t feeling well and he made no attempt to get it, he had a sour look on his face the whole flight and he would just look at you instead of asking \"what drink would you like\" etc. Everything seemed like a hassle to him and every interaction with him was awkward. The airline is acceptable but if you have the money, fly any other airline with a better reputation).', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Ft Lauderdale. Bought a connecting flight for my return to Miami. The first plane arrived at EWR late and the airplain taking us to Miami departed early. When we wen to customer service for accomodations, they booked us (my daughter and I) on a flight that didnâ€™t even take us to Miami, it took us to Ft Lauderdale instead and they sat my daughter ten seats away from me. My bags were delivered to Miami on the wrong flight. I am writing this review from Newark to Ft Lauderdale. My plane leaves at 10:06. I am hoping I can have my bag delivered when I get to Fort Lauderdale. My bags are some where now in Miami International Airport. United Airlines had poor logistics coordination. Customer service agents are not caring, and they remove themselves from the responsibility of answering a simple question. I purchased a connecting flight and because of their negligence I ended up paying for a hotel in New Jersey with no coats to protect ourselves from the cold. Me and my daughter stranded by this airline and they didnâ€™t do anything to help us for this inconvenience. I know, I am never flying United again. This is the only way I express my frustration.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | New Orleans to Denver. If I could rate zero, I would! Worst customer service. I would say we are frequent travelers and this is the worst airline by far Iâ€™ve ever flown! Total lack of customer service. Takes a lot for me to leave a review. Refused to provide any kind of assistance in letting our family sit together, no control over seat selection whatsoever, and wanted to charge us $50 per carry-on each way!! Save yourself the time and headache of this airline. What ever happened to trying to accommodate?', \"united airlines Flew Dallas Fort Worth to Washington. I was a Continental frequent flyer for years before the United-Continental merger, and all was good. I continued to achieve Platinum Elite status in all these recent years despite the problems United has continued to have. I lived through disastrous operations during the merger, including having a phone agent cancel my flight on me while I was on the way to the airport to get on that flight. In all these bad years, for the most part, you could get a sense that the customer service agents had directions to try to find some way to resolve significant complaints. A few frequent flier miles here, a small value travel voucher there. They have clearly abandoned doing that. In the major operations mistakes they made with me over the past year and a half, their approach, as on my most recent bad experience, is to offer no solution. They now just have a cookie cutter, fill in the blanks 'we're sorry and we appreciate your business' reply. What I have now resolved is that I am done with United. They no longer work to earn my business, so I will now endeavor to fly with anyone except United.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Fort Walton via Houston. This has honestly been the worst experience I have had with any airline. First, they make us pay to check our luggage, so if you think you're getting a good deal on your flight, think again. Then, the gate number changed 3 times during our layover in Houston with only 1 hour to spare and the gates were on exact opposite ends of the airport. My husband recently had bilateral hip replacement and was not able to sprint to either end of the airport in a timely fashion, so we consequently missed our flight. The woman at the check in was rude and told us we weren't paying attention, when in fact we were trying to run from the other end of the airport to make it in time. Then we went to customer service to attempt to reach some sort of resolution, and were met with hostility and deflection. We are now stuck at this airport until tomorrow afternoon. A 20 hr layover because they refuse to take responsibility for their incompetence.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United from Newark to San Francisco. 2.5 hr+ delay. They made us sit in the cabin the whole time. No compensation offered. Actually, they offered $10 when I hassled them. Was able to get off briefly, then told to get back on again 10 minutes later. It was also 45 minutes delayed on the way out. Also, they wouldn't allow me to check in without someone checking to see if my bag would fit under the seat. As if I was a 4 year old. Never ever fly United. Horrible. Not even worth the mileage.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to St. Louis. First time flying with United and the last. Had us late for the connecting flight and had to wait many hours for another flight. Our luggage made it on flight but we missed it after running to the other end of the airport. Lost one whole day on our trip. Never again! They said to keep checking the United app online but WiFi was that bad you could not access it! Stand by on the next flight 2 hrs later which was delayed another hour - poor!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Tucson. Terrible airline. Will never use them again. Multiple times while using them, the flight has been delayed. Thankfully this time I had a direct flight and did not need to connect. I have never had a problem with other airlines (American, Southwest, Delta etc). I fully expect the the airline to do their job and be prompt. Ridiculous. Never again will United receive a dime of airfare from me, or any of my relatives/friends.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Worst customer service I have ever experienced. This is my first time flying with United and also my last! I was waiting in line for a kiosk with my friend on our flight back from Denver. Her kiosk went through and was able to check a bag, however, mine did not. We checked in at the same exact time as shown on my ticket printed from the kiosk showing me to go see additional services. They had me wait in line for 20 plus minutes after they knew I was already running late. As soon as I got up to the lady she tells me it is too late and I cannot get on the flight. I asked there has to be an alternative, and explained my roommate who I came with and was my ride also we showed up together at the same time and she was able to check her bags. I spoke with a supervisor as she told me the same thing, there is nothing they can do but put me on a 6pm flight (mind you it was 9am at this time) and I was originally on the 6pm flight and they moved me to the 9am flight because of weather delays in Philadelphia. This being said they did nothing to help try to accommodate me and did not show one bit of guilt or sorrow in any way. I went ahead and bought an American Airlines ticket and they were amazing. Do not fly with United!', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I was disgusted during my entire journey from Newark to San Diego with United Airlines. Not sure if I was singled out or not but I was forced to check-in my carry-on. I carried my suitcase for a reason, I didnt want to check it in. Already annoyed, I boarded the plane to find out that there were multiple issues with the plane causing us to wait onboard. After several hours they told us we could deplane, use the restrooms and grab a quick bite. Being one of the first off the plane, the lady at the door said with an attitude that if we weren't back when they close the doors then we were out of luck. I asked her if there was going to be an announcement. She said we will announce it at the door but not over the loud speaker. How can you say that to people that are deplaning? It's their duty to announce the closing of the gate so everyone that left can hear. Long story short, there was a 6 hour delay and we had to board a new plane. We were given $10 voucher for food but that couldnt even buy me a sandwich. I lost all of my daylight time at my destination. Annoyed about having to wait at baggage claim, once I recieved my carry-on I noticed all of the zippers were opened. This is not my idea of a vacation.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Started with 1 hour and 45 min flight delay out to Santa Ana. The crew were unbelievably rude. Poor elderly folks trying to catch their connecting flights were trying to figure out what they should do and the advise is this, \"if it were me, I would get off the plane and find another day to fly\" or it was a short and impatient tone. The same crew responded to me in the same way when I asked if they could let the gate of the connecting flight know that I would be running almost a half a mile accross the airport to reach my connection. After running accross the airport and reaching my connecting gate, the guy manning the stand said I\\'m sorry they pulled the bridge back already, the plane had not even left yet. This was the last flight out for the night which led to me missing an event. The next day, the app made me walk a mile out of the way to the wrong terminal. I finally got on the plane and guess what, the plane happens to be the smallest plane available. To give you perspective, I am 6\\'7m, the height of the roof of the plane was about 5\\'8. To top it all off, my flight was 30 min delayed on my final departure. I will never again fly with United Airlines.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | I have flown on countless airlines, internationally and domestically and today, I encountered the worst of my experiences with United Airlines 18 hours before I even needed to be at the airport. Upon receiving multiple emails reminding me that it was time to check in for my flight, I went to the website to check in only to be told that I could not. After multiple attempts on multiple devices, I finally received an email telling me to call United in order to check in. The associates informed me that I could not check in due to the fact that I had booked an economy ticket and did not have a checked bag. If I purchased a checked bag, I would be able to check in online. Please note that this policy change is new and it is buried in the fine print way down a page that can be accessed through a prompt that is in fine print, in a nearly transparent color. There is a red box on the page where you confirm your ticket that offers trip advisory/restrictions on the flight and it can be seen clear as day and this policy is not addressed there. You have to dig for it. I needed the mobile pass due to scheduling and not being able to get to the airport in enough time to wait in line to check in and then again to get through security and after speaking to 3 people, I was informed that there was nothing that any of them could do. So now, 18 hours before I even get to the airport, United has already wasted my time, messed up my schedule, misled me and tried to extort me into purchasing the checked bag (which I don't need), just so I can get the mobile boarding pass and adhere to my schedule. Don't let it happen to you. Such a scam.\", \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Auckland to Boston via San Francisco. Absolutely terrible airline. On the way from Boston to Auckland, our first flight was delayed (for no apparent reason) causing us to miss our connecting flight in California. After significant asking, we were transferred to an American flight from LA to Auckland, because otherwise we would be stuck in California. Being aboard the American Airlines flight was actually such a luxury, the seats reclined and the TV's actually worked. Unfortunately we had to fly United back from Auckland to Boston. The seats were cramped, hardly reclined. Then flying back from SFO to Boston, the flight attendants were rude and we actually didn't even get pretzels. Only a glass of water for a 5 hour and 20 minute flight.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Terrible company. I used to think it was one of the best companies to travel with. Never traveling with them again. Our flight got delayed in Miami and had a connecting flight to Denver from Houston obviously missed our flight in Houston. Company refused to pay for our hotel room and claimed it was not their fault. Not even offered a amenity bag with products. Traveled with lower cost airlines had a better treatment. Next day flew to Denver from Houston made me pay 50$ for a small personal bag. Are you kidding me?', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Jose to Houston via Denver. Very bad service with United. My fiancÃ© and I had tickets together and selected seats on both flights but when we checked in they were changed twice and there were people in our seats with our same seat number on our ticket so we were forced to move.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Columbus. Nearly missed the flight because they changed gates (to a completely different area of the airport) and only informed us through an indecipherable, static-y speaker. Extremely annoyed. Last time I flew with them, I missed my first flight on a round trip ticket because of a job interview. They cancelled my return flight with no refund and did not send an email or anything about it. It probably said that would happen in the fine print, but an email would have been nice.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Vienna to Newark via Zurich with United (Vienna to Zurich on Austrian, Zurich to Newark on United). We checked in two days before the flight and reserved seats, my one was 24K, so we do not sit split across the whole plane. When we arrived at the gate in Zurich, they gave us new Boarding cards with other seats across the whole plane. As we flew with our children, my wife and me would like to sit next to them. But United couldn't change the seats, so we had to accept it. Finally in the plane, most of the flight attendants were very rude, there was just one friendly FA on board. The food tasted horrible. It was the worst I've ever eaten in my whole life. Also the wifi didn't work. During the flight, the FA's were gone, we couldn't order something to drink and all the rubbish had to go into the seat pocket. Just before landing they handed out something like a Leach-Pizza piece. That also didn't taste good and it was full of fat. We aren't going to fly on this airline again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Orlando, FL to Philadelphia, PA. 10 and a half hours sitting in airports! Our first flight was delayed an hour and a half due to Unitedâ€™s fault, causing us to miss our connection. The next flight United could offer us was 9 hours later because they over booked all other flights. This is unacceptable! Basically, if you miss your flight due to Unitedâ€™s fault, you will be stuck sitting in the airport for many hours with a paltry $10 food voucher. Never flying United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Savannah. Extremely disappointed in my recent experience with United. I was flying back home from EWR with my carry-on dog. I had all the necessary paperwork, carrier, and I had purchased the dog a ticket as instructed (note: this was my first time flying with my dog on a United flight, I usually fly JetBlue with her). When I go to board the woman scanning my ticket said she was changing my seat for me. I said \"thank you\" thinking that would be a nice gesture, but I was wrong. Once on board she came on the plane and told me that I was not allowed to sit in that seat (the one she changed me to) with a pet because it had no seat in front of it to stow the animal. I asked if I could move back to my original seat and she told me no. The flight attendants, as well as other people on the plane tried to talk her into letting me change my seat and she still refused, called a manager, and proceeded to kick me off of my flight. It was the most HORRIFIC experience in my entire life. She booked me on a later flight and forgot to transfer my dog over to that ticket, so when I boarded the later flight they were giving me a difficult time having the dog. This I do understand because they didn\\'t have a record of it. However, once we got it all sorted out and everything was fine, they attendants refused to give me any water or take my trash. It was like I never existed on the flight! I am blown away by how inconsiderate and rude United was to me. From the ticket lady to the flight attendants on my later flight. It seems that across the board they value unprofessional behavior. I am originally from NJ so I do understand the somewhat lack of compassion inside the actual airport, but that isn\\'t something that should transfer over to the airline or flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Jackson to Aspen via Houston. I will never book a flight with United again. First I called not once but three times to verify I could carry my wedding dress on and specifically how it would be packed and the measurements of the bag which did fall into their accepted guidelines. I checked in at Jackson, MS and could not carry my dress on, or theyâ€™d charge me $50. So I had to check the bag, which I was NEVER told about a baggage charge, two of us flying, 4 bags checked - $120.00!!! Then, I understood the small aircraft to Houston, but to Aspen? Seriously? I will say the staff on the second flight was very nice but the pretzels served, all 5 of them (yes sarcasm), the pretzels were smaller than my fingernail but what really made me disgusted was when they were picking up the trash, we noticed they stacked the plastic drinking cups, trust me they were cocktail size cups, later they came by offering water & I realized they simply rinsed the cups!', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to San Jose. This is the second time I have a problem with United Airlines in the past couple of months. I purchased 3 last minute one way tickets to Costa Rica directly through the airline. When I checked out there was no notifications of having to purchase an onward ticket. When I got to airport I missed my flight because I was told I needed a round trip ticket to board and the only one they had available was over $800 Iâ€™d have to purchase 3 of them right away and I couldnâ€™t afford it. When I let the United Airlines representative know I was a Costa Rican citizen she asked if my 12 year old and 2 year old â€œwhere Costa Rican citizens as wellâ€\\x9d when I told her no she continued to ask if â€œthey had same father, because Iâ€™d need consent from them to leave the countryâ€\\x9d I thought that question was extremely rude and felt she asked me that only because of my ethnicity due to the fact she asked if I spoke English right from the start without me even speaking! Honestly made me cry from feeling so humiliated. United Airlines should worn people when buying one way tickets and most importantly should train staff to be more courteous specially in such vulnerable situations.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to Santa Rosa via San Francisco. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. I will not use United Airlines ever again! I did not receive notice that my flights were being delayed. Santa Rosa was fogged in, told me I could take a shuttle or drive myself to San Francisco to make my connecting flight, but would not comp the shuttle ride, even though the other airlines were and no compensation for the fact that I was only using half of the flight I paid for. On my way back to Santa Rosa from Portland they delayed my flight by 3 hours, once again with no notice sent to me, and then made my lay over in San Fran 4.5 hours. When I asked for my luggage to take another shuttle since I only live an hour and a half away, they told me I would have to wait 2 hours to get it. They said I could pick it up in Santa Rosa since it would fly with or without me on the plane. I agreed and took the shuttle to Santa Rosa. When I got to the Santa Rosa airport, I went to United and asked about picking up my bag, they said that I could not pick it up after 6pm because they were closed but could deliver my bag to me instead, they took my address name and phone number as well as my bag number. I watched them (I could see and read the screen) pull up my bag info in their system and attach it to an email with all my information and directions on delivering my bag next day to my address between 6-8pm. 6-8pm comes and call the airline, get the run around about them saying that the person I spoke to never submitted a claim, and they have no record of the email that I watched him send being sent. Had to repeatly insist on speaking to a supervisor before being put through only to end up still without any idea of when or if I'll get my luggage back. In the end, I'm out 1 day of my vacation, $64.00 on shuttles that should have been connecting flights already paid for and my luggage.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to San Diego.

I have never had issues with any other airline, it is clear that United has many problems and does not know how to deal with any of them. I have been on a flight that they overbooked by 40 people coming back from Switzerland. I have flown with them to Shanghai in the summer of 2017 and the flight was not only delayed by 13 hours but they also kept us on the plane for 8 of those hours without providing us any reasoning or even doing the simple act of giving us water. And today, my flight to Chicago was delayed so I missed my connecting flight to Hartford which I had to rebook and now that second flight is also delayed.

This would not have been an issue but I checked with an United airline agent on two separate contacts days prior to our departure. Our initial flight was accommodating as we had a handicapped person with us but upon arrival to Dulles our airport agent was very unfriendly and of no assistance to a ticketing issue.

Why do they offer cheaper flights if they go out of their way to punish you. They make strenuous concerted efforts to make your life difficult. There were 12 window and aisle seats available and I asked for one. \"No. With your kind of ticket you get what you get.\" Made us low life \"discount\" ticket purchasers wait while 30 people on stand by got called up individually, got their ticket, and boarded in front of us with their aisle and window seats. Absolutely pointless. They really go out of their way. If they want to exhibit vein-popping fury when you got a meager $20 discount for the basic economy ticket that was $500 then they should stop offering such services and just let themselves get beat out by better options.', 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Newark. Do not fly United Airlines. They donâ€™t allow any free carry-on of any type anymore. I had a tiny carry-on bag with a pair of jeans and a shirt and they told me I had to check it with a charge of $50. The attendants are rude and there is no seat selection. My flight was over an hour late so my ride had to wait an extra hour. Everything was done wrong. Iâ€™ve never complained about a flight before but this is my first United Airlines and definitely my last.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Ahmedabad return via Mumbai to travel later in November. The most garbage airline. They don't have moral and ethics. They have issued me a ticket worth $2400 for 4 passengers (3 adults and 1 infant). Some kind of problem with the payment processing system. After 4 days they wanted to charge me $3870 for the same ticket. They don't want to honor their own system.\", 'united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Chicago O\\'Hare to Tampa. We purchased our first class tickets on Aug. 4th 2017. We were given the option of selecting our seats so we did. (Seat 3A and 3B). We wanted to sit next to one another as most married couples do. Fast forward to today when we used the United Airline app to check in and download our boarding passes. Once we had gotten them and started to look them over guess what we found out? Our seats had been changed. When we called to verify we were told by someone not speaking very good English that since the plane was changed our seats had to be changed. I asked if this plane had seats 3A and 3B on it. We were told that indeed it did, but those were already occupied. We were then told that we agreed to \"any necessary changes in planes or seat assignments\" when we agreed to the \"terms and conditions\" of our ticket purchase. Since we don\\'t have any way of changing airlines at such a late date we will have to live with not sitting in the same row as we had planned. This is the second time in as many first class flights that United has done this to us. I guess someone paid more money or had better connections then we did. Don\\'t count on being treated like a paying customer by this airline. Once they have your money they don\\'t care if you are happy flying the friendly skies or not.', \"united airlines âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Houston. Every time I fly United, I think they can't be that bad. And every time Iâ€™m wrong.

I arrived an hour before my scheduled flight and the employee checking us in made us walk across the airport to buy a card which would allow us to check our bags in and then when we arrived back to her at 5:38 am, she told me that they already closed the gates and wasnâ€™t letting one in. The flight wasnâ€™t until 6 am and I couldnâ€™t believe she wouldnâ€™t let us in by 5:38 am. I will never use this airline again. Iâ€™ve never experienced such a thing.', 'united airlines â\\x9d\\x8e Not Verified | Phoenix to Houston. Took this flight for a Job interview in Houston and ended up not being able to make it to the interview unless I would have had $600 to purchase another plane ticket to leave later in the evening. I had called with in an hour of purchasing the tickets when I had realized the time was not going to work for me and was told there were not any other flights just that I would have to purchase a more expensive ticket to get what I would want. So I decided to try and make it work and one thing lead to another and I didnâ€™t make it to the interview. I would definitely recommend that United think more of there customers and not the bottom line but I am probably the one in a million that actually wrote a review that wrote a reply to your questionnaire. Good Luck and thank you but no thank you I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | New York to Seattle via Washington. Delayed flying from New York to DC thus arrived 25 minutes late. Missed the connecting flight despite the plane still standing at the gate. Arrived at 9:30pm with a rescheduled flight. Instead of 3.30pm. United did not offer an apology. Donâ€™t waste your time and money with an airline that has no standards.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Taking a flight with United is worse than riding a bus. At least with a bus you can get off and walk or talk to the driver so you know what is going on. Shortly after booking our flight our layover was extended 4 hours with no option to reject this or get a refund. Now I am sitting her and layover continues to be extended with no communication. This is by far the worst airline. They used to set the standard and now their standards are nowhere to be found.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Boston to Denver. The rudest and most unapologetic airline staff and counter agents. Flying from Boston to Denver and the flight keeps getting further and further delayed every half hour. Went for a 9:10pm landing time to 11:44pm! When I asked why the flight was being delayed over and over the woman who showed up 2 hrs after we were set to take off at the ticket counter says\" this happens 20 times a day. It\\'s delayed out of Newark\" - no \"I\\'m sorry for any inconvenience, I apologize\" no nothing! Just a rude and obviously annoyed staff with no regard for the customer experience at all! I will never fly out of Boston again and will avoid United at all costs!', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Havana. What a terrible experience. I would expect at least a small meal for a 4 hr flight. None. On the way to Havana there was in-flight entertainment but you had to pay for this! I didn\\'t know this was possible nowadays. Beyond this, the quality was so bad, it was definitely not worth it. I asked whether I could buy food and she asked what I wanted and left, my husband didn\\'t even get a chance to order something himself. When the flight attendant came back with my food, my husband ordered something and I overheard one flying attendant saying to the other \"now the guy also wants something\" in a bad tone. Seriously? Also, there was no restriction on carry-on baggage size, so people had such oversized carry-ons that all the compartments were basically full before half of the people had entered the plane. On my way back the seats didn\\'t even have screens! I felt like I was in the 90s. And there was no fresh food available, only snacks to purchase. One of the flight attendants was super unfriendly. What a bad experience. I didn\\'t book the flight myself but if I ever get the chance, I would never book a flight with United Airlines. The only good thing about it is the nice terminal at EWR.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Perhaps the most uncomfortable flight in 40+ years of flying. Flight segment from Newark to SLC on a 737 offered the most cramped seating in memory. Legroom/seat pitch was the smallest I\\'ve experienced. When I asked the flight attendant if there was a better seat available, and if so what the upcharge might be, he offered to move me to a seat with a vacant center seat so that I could sit crossways with my legs under the middle seat. After an hour or so \"restless leg syndrome\" set in, a very unusual condition for me, and remained for the duration of the flight. I spent the last hour plus standing up. I should add that there were legroom seats available, but not offered. I strongly resent being required to pay $100 plus for such an upgrade, even if it had been offered. The seat pitch in economy is absolutely unacceptable for me. I also resent being required to pay for any video.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Portland via Newark. After having received no email invitation to check in for this flight, I called the UAL phone number to check in. I notified the agent that I was extremely dissatisfied with the seat comfort (legroom) on my last flight and requested an upgrade. He offered an upgrade for $99 and refused to change my seat until I paid this. I paid it, but the process took over 20 minutes when he was unable to communicate well enough to take down my billing information (both the CC number and the address were taken incorrectly more than once). His English was only marginal. The process was extremely aggravating and I resent being required to pay extra for adequate legroom. If the airline had clearly communicated their available legroom on the original booking, I would have booked another airline with more. I will spare no effort to avoid flying United Airlines again. This experience makes a mockery of the concept of \"the Friendly Skies\".', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Louisville to Phoenix via Chicago. This is ridiculous. Now you not only have to pay for food but you also are provided with no entertainment in a 4-hour flight, unless you pay for Direct TV. The worst part is you are forced to pay with credit card if you want to see old movies such as The Lion King or Office Space. How can they rip you off that badly? They force to travel like sardines, they have no empty seats so checking in and out of flights involves standing in long lines to make sure that when you get on board your carry-on luggage will have space. They keep asking us for our cooperation because of a full flight. What do they do to make sure we have an enjoyable flight? We have to pay for food if we want it, pay for entertainment and suffer through the entire flight with the extra tiny space that they have given us in, for example, a Boeing 737. We, us customers, deserve a little better than this. Now you pay for checked bags, what are they going to charge us next? It needs to stop.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Richmond to Chicago. Customer service is the worst, if you would like to prevent your bags from being destroyed, it's best to pack light and carry on the plane, or check in your bag at the airplane. I purchased a bran new bag before flying and United destroyed it. Im not someone that flies all the time, so I didn't know I needed to get this taken care of within 24 hours, flying for the first time in 10 years and flying to Chicago was scary and it was a business trip. So I decided to wait until I got back to Richmond as I figured my bag would just get destroyed more. Once in Richmond the lady in the baggage desk for United just wanted to argue with me that the quality of my bag wasnt good. Didn't even apologize that United destroyed my bag. And for that lack of empathy on her part, I will never fly United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Newark. Worst airline Iâ€™ve ever flown, and will be the last time for me to fly this airline. Itâ€™s absurd that someone cannot even pay for an upgrade, and be treated with disrespect from a rude United airline employee for requesting to do so.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Palm Springs to San Francisco. Bought economy ticket which only allowed personal item to bring on plane and small size carry on. Suitcase needs to be checked it with $25 charge. However it was clearly stated on United web that if you have United explorer Credit card you can bring small suitcase Carry on to the plane free of charge. I was told during check in that ticket must be purchased with United explorer Credit card in order to bring carry on inside plane free of charge. I bought ticket with a different card I kept showing them United web but they would not pay attention and charged me $25.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Tampa to San Jose via Houston. Check in at TPA was quick and efficient. Boarding was timely and disciplined. Once we were all.seated and the main door was closed, the captain came on the PA to announce that there was a mechanical issue that would take at least an hour to fix. We all disembarked and general panic set in amongst those of us who were connecting in Houston. The experienced flyers amongst us understood that a one hour mechanical delay is usually the precursor to a cancelled flight, a missed connection, and an overnight stay in Houston. The harried gate agents began to reschedule connecting passengers. They had made some progress with the long line of nervous customers when at exactly one hour later, the head agent came on the PA to announce that a hydraulic leak had been repaired and that we were ready to reboard and depart for IAH. On both flights, I had the window seat in the forward over-wing emergency exit with the middle seat unoccupied. This is the seat I always reserve because the leg room is awesome and the passenger in front of you can't recline into your space. On the IAH-SJO flight I had the whole row to myself, which in some aspects is better than getting upgraded to 1st class. Pretzels and beverages were distributed efficiently on both flights, and more elaborate snacks and meals were available for purchase. The attendants were pleasant and courteous, the flights were smooth, and we arrived in San Jose safe, sound, and early. Despite the delay departing from Tampa, this turned out to be a pleasant day of flying.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Bismarck to Pittsburgh. Flight there was bearable but my flight back got cancelled on me (it may have been my fault) but the airport staff was terrible. They were basically saying well suck for you itâ€™s not my problem. I ended up having to drive because of the absurd prices. Then the sad thing is that we went over to Delta and they were the nicest people ever and tried to help me. Later my brother left the same day to Fargo and his flight got so delayed that he missed his next flight. I ended up having to pick him up on my way just so he could get back without having to buy a whole other ticket.

Ok, I understand seating is full but does she need to be rude about it? Is this United Airlines value for customers service? Iâ€™m very disappointed and even though my review may not make a difference it is frustrating and sad knowing that a big known company such as United airlines donâ€™t value their customers.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines from Chicago to Kalamazoo. Terrible customer service. The gentlemen working at the desk would not provide any information for the delay, and would not look me in the eyes while talking to me. They do not care about their customers, and their planes always seem to break down. Shame on me for flying United.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago. United used to be a good airline company. In the past, if youâ€™d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, and you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, thatâ€™s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family. Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). Iâ€™m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, itâ€™s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage Iâ€™ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply canâ€™t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt they were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldnâ€™t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc. I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called â€œdeveloping countriesâ€\\x9d are better than United Airlines and treat their customers better than they do. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, From now on, I am going to make sure of one thing: to only put my feet on United Airlines planes if I have absolutely no other choice.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Dallas via Houston. Worst airline I have ever flown in the world. Their ground staff, phone customer service, email response everything is pathetic. Frequent delays, poor service is unparalleled. Only business theyâ€™d get from me is because of their fleet size they have flights options suitable for me. I have promised myself to not fly United until that is my last option available.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to San Jose. Paid $140 for a basic one way flight, and I could not choose my seats, and bring a simple duffel bag. I have flown many other airlines such as Alaska, southwest, virgin, American Airlines, and they did not charge me for my duffel bag and they even let me sit where I choose once I board the plane.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Houston to San JosÃ©. Unfortunately, United is the most convenient option to travel to SJO, nonetheless, I will try to avoid flying with this airline from now on. I canâ€™t overstate how despicable and negligent they are, and how completely impervious they are to their customer concerns or needs. They can keep their miles. Pathetic International \"service\" with no luggage room.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Albuquerque to San Francisco. First, our flight was cancelled and they texted us with an alternative flight leaving a day later, with a 9 hour layover! I'm, excuse me? Since this was a weekend trip we would have had to turn around and get back on a flight back to SF a few hours later. I called and they didn't even offer the option to refund the ticket! I finally got us on an alternative flight leaving earlier after waiting for 30 minutes to speak with a supervisor because the person I initially spoke with had no power to do anything to help. We ended up flying Alaska Airlines on the way there and I wish we had originally booked through them because the way back was awful. They wouldn't seat my partner and I together because we were flying Economy class, which they reminded us of repeatedly when I complained. The agents claimed they had no power to do anything because of the computer system which randomly selects your seats. I asked what about people traveling with small children and they didn't seem to have an answer. As if we got a better deal than with any other airline out there after all the bag fees. Oh yeah, that's another thing. The Economy class/the majority of the people flying have no carryon allowance. By the way, when we got on the flight we were able to sit next to each other because the seats next to us weren't even occupied. Ridiculous. Never flying United again. I've been bumped off of flights and had bad experiences before but this was the last straw for me.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Boise to Hilo via Los Angeles.

First class left much to be desired. Typically when we have flown in First, we are offered a beverage while waiting for passengers to board and during taxi. Not the case with our flight.

No pillows! No snacks! Did have a cheap blanket. Flight attendants, well..', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My last trip on United Airlines left me feeling angry, tricked, humiliated and disrespected. The new Basic Economy fair offered by United appears to be a marketing trick to make their lowest fair seem competitive with other airlines' basic fares. They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one's boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one's allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment that they cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter's personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child's size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before getting to the airport. One is forced to print one's boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process with having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, but I was able to get the bag into the box. I was very tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter's very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. The suitcase fit with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. The kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn't even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to get another attendant to finish printing them. The attendants are there for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever. Despise United.\", 'united airlines This was a truly terrible experience flying from St. Louis to Newark. The plane looked like it was going to fall to pieces. No idea why United has such planes degrading their name. You had the feeling that you were sitting on a seat that belonged on the dump. The only good thing I can say is that the flight attendant was friendly. Going to the bathroom the lock jammed. The handle fell off. I was glad that I had not locked the door when I saw this. I decided that I did not need to go. The enclosed picture shows the general state of this horrid plane.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United staff were incredibly rude to me.

Not a full flight so we found some seats to stretch out in, as soon as I got comfortable in my new seat I was informed that I had to relocate to my original cell of torture - again, for no apparent reason.

Suffice it to say, I will avoid flying this airline at all costs.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | We booked to travel from Cincinnati to Chicago at 7:30AM to catch our international flight at 1:03 PM. United Airlines delayed the flight due to some maintenance issue and when we asked them to transfer our reservation for the next flight or book us with some other airline they said nothing is available for the time we wanted but when we personally checked for available flights we saw it was available. When we asked them to do it they showed inability and we could not fly with other airlines too bacause this airline wasted the time and we missed our international flight and we lost $860 for it's cancellation and more $3540 amount for new tickets also. It's like we are paying for United Airlines mistake. We were going after 2 years to our country and they simply said sorry for whatever happened.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Total scam! I purchased a basic economy which does not include luggage, but was told if I get a United Airlines credit card, I would get the first bag free. The United Airlines credit card has $95 annual fee, which is high, but if I get priority seating and 1 free bag, it will be worth it. When I check in, none of what they told me is true. Not only that, I could not check in my very small backpack on wheels because basic economy does not allow any carry on that fits in the overhead bin. No matter how much money I was willing to pay extra to keep my very small bag, smaller than airline regulation size bag with me, it was not an option and I had to pay $25 for the first checked bag and $35 for the second checked bag. The sales people push you to get their credit card with $95 annual fee and you get nothing in return - no priority seating and no carry on bag when you purchase basic economy ticket.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew San Francisco to Orlando. Two words, never again. I fly very often and I will no longer fly United. As I arrived to the gate the women checking the tickets let me know by her body language that I would not enjoy my flight. She appeared as though she hated her job, was irritated, and completely unwelcoming. Never looked up to take my ticket or anything. Once I scanned my ticket I was told I had to check my bag, there were still about 40 people waiting to board the plane. When asked why I received attitude of \"it just does, there is no room on the plane.\" As I get on the plane I notice empty overhead bins everywhere and as I am walking down I see that a majority of the bags are small personal items. Purses, small backpacks, plastic bags. So basically I had to check my bag because United fails to enforce policy and as well prematurely calls the aircraft \"full\". The whole point of me traveling light is so that I do not have to check my bag as this is one of the biggest headaches about traveling. I\\'ll tell you I have never had this issue on competing airlines. Judging by the reviews of 3/10 I\\'d say that is accurate. Moving forward I would rather pay more than have to deal with this unfriendly, unwelcoming, and inconvenient airline.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Tokyo Narita.

Having flowing in and out of McCarran International Airport quite frequently on early morning flights, I knew that I should be able to move through things fairly quickly. I arrived at the airport at 5:05 AM. I went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and was stopped. United Airlines employees told me that I was too late to get on my 5:50 AM flight, and that I would have to wait in the ticketing line to rebook my flight. I kept trying to explain to them that at I still had over forty-five minutes until my flight left and that I wasn\\'t checking any baggage, but they wouldn\\'t listen to me. Instead, they forced me to stand in a ticketing line for 20 minutes by which point it really was too late for me to make the flight. When I got to the counter the woman rebooking me acted as though I was checking my back. When I explained that I wasn\\'t, she got what can only be described as an \"oh no\" look on her face. Then, she very apologetically explained to me that a mistake had been made, and that I should have been permitted to pass through and get on the flight. Apparently, despite having tried to explain the exact same thing multiple times to the other employees they chose to stop me anyway. I had missed the cut off for passengers trying to check luggage (45 mins) but not for people just trying to print their boarding pass and go straight through to the flight (30 mins). What made it even more frustrating was that I arrived in the terminal at the gate for my first flight before it had even taken off. At that point, I should have been offered some sort of compensation for the wasted time, but United didn\\'t give me anything. I filed an official complaint on the website, but unfortunately I don\\'t have any proof of what actually happened, and so I don\\'t expect that it will be resolved in my favor. I definitely will not be flying them again if I can avoid it.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Grand Rapids to Newark. Worst customer service ever. I will not use United Airlines again.They have nothing good to offer besides a cheap flight. My luggage was destroyed and they said they were not responsible. The ac unit on the entire plane was out, nothing was offered. And on another flight my chair was broken and wouldn't stay in one position. Super uncomfortable ride. I definitely do not recommend.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | The flight from Taipei to Las Vegas via San Francisco was very good! Better than expected. However, dealing with United Airlines customer services is another story. We wanted to cancel our return leg of Las Vegas to San Francisco as the transfer time is too tight and did not want to miss our international flight San Francisco to Taipei. I called customer services and at first they were quite polite on the phone until they told me I had to pay a cancelation fee of US$100. So, I said OK, what if we do not cancel the flight, but just donâ€™t board the plane? They responded by saying I would still have to pay US$100. I asked why? UA will be able to resell the seats and I am not asking for a refund. Then she started being condescending and patronizing. I was outraged by their logic and treatment. How can they call themselves customer services? They did not service this customer!', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Charlotte to Munich. I purchased a premium economy ticket through United (a Lufthansa operated flight) for approx 3000.00, get a receipt for economy, I call and they said it will be changed. Cannot check in until day of flight or pick my seat. They tell me at checkin that that is the price for economy! That is twice as much as their partner Lufthansa and 600 more than premium economy. Total rip off bait and switch, worse service. All about the money with no concern for customers. They are in the news all the time for a reason and that is because they don't have credibility. Will never fly them again!\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Louisville to Tulsa via Chicago. The only reason they got any stars is because no stars wasnâ€™t an option. Absolutely the worst! I picked up my checked bag at the baggage claim. Halfway out to my car I checked to see why it was pulling funny to find that the baggage handlers had somehow managed to break the frame of duffle bag. When I got home I called to make a claim only to be told that there was no way for them to correct the issue unless I drive an hour and a half back to the airport. Southwest might treat you like cattle but at least theyâ€™ve resolved every issue Iâ€™ve ever had.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Des Moines to Orlando via Chicago. Basic Economy ticket, though my pregnant wife and I did not realize the restrictions now in place. We usually fly Delta, but booked these tickets later than usual and Delta flights from DSM were limited. I cannot believe any company would think it\\'s is a good idea to force families or groups to not sit together. Even if there is extra room on the aircraft, they will not allow you to change seats. Tried online, tried when checking on at front desk, tried prior to boarding at the gate. These tickets were not basement bargains by any means. We were disappointed with United two years ago (last time we flew them), now we are absolutely disgusted. I don\\'t care if you hold off on assigning seats until at the gate, for your \"cheapest tickets\". But if there are empty seats in the economy cabin, let families, groups, kids, parents, and couples, have the opportunity to sit next to eachother. Really, it does not matter, for you will never have our business again. And we will be strongly encouraging others to follow suit. We tried your services again expecting sub par service, and honestly were even more disappointed. Please stay away from this airline. Worst on the business, does care about it\\'s customers. I feel sorry for the people working on this sinking ship.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Ottawa to Washington. FA serving drinks put a full glass of juice on my six-year old son's tray. It immediately slid off onto his lap. She tossed napkins at us and got some paper towels from the FA working in the small first class cabin. The man behind my son seemed to have got some juice on his pants which passed through the back of my son's seat. The FA apologized up and down to him, advising him on how he could get some compensation and telling him how sorry she was. I was sitting there with a soaking wet six-year old. I told the FA that she put the drink down and it slid right off the tray. She proceeded to give me a lecture about how there's an indented part of the tray specifically for glasses and that when an airplane is ascending, it is on an angle - talking to me - a seasoned 1K or Global Services flier with United - as if I'm the six-year old. I found the purser and told him about the rudeness of his flying partner. He apologized profusely and said he'd speak with her. Completely unacceptable response by the FA working in the economy cabin.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines is an absolute mess. I was supposed to make an international flight from Chattanooga to Hamburg with two layovers in Newark, NJ and Copenhagen. Well the United flight from Chattanooga to Newark was cancelled due to â€œair traffic problemsâ€\\x9d. There was never any notification of the cancellation and everyone had to find out at check in. Since I was supposed to be making an international flight, they quickly rebooked me to fly to Chicago, then Frankfurt, then Hamburg. The flight from Chattanooga to Chicago was decent. I had a 4 hour layover in Chicago waiting to board my international flight to Frankfurt. As I was boarding the employees pulled me aside and told me my boarding pass wasnâ€™t valid. They said I was booked going to Stockholm in the computer system. So they didnâ€™t let me board the plane until they could figure out whatâ€™s going on. Then the plane closed the door and took off without me because they couldnâ€™t sort out my ticket situation. So whoever rebooked my ticket, did something completely wrong - gave me a boarding pass that wasnâ€™t actually valid, and I missed an overnight international flight. Since the error was 110% due to Unitedâ€™s employees lacking the simple skills to print a valid ticket, I was at least given a hotel room for the night. Unbelievable that this would happen.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Chicago to Dayton. I wanted to see the quality of United as we always fly American. Let's say I'd rather fly with Spirit Airlines. I will never book another flight with them. First we taxi out to the runway and wait for 15 minutes, then we turn back and go to the terminal and 3 people get off the plane. Let me tell you there was no communication at all to us. And we are now 45 min past departure time. We were supposed to be landing by the time we took off. Absolutely terrible.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | We got on the tarmac to leave from Philadelphia, right as we were about to take off the captain announced that there was a maintenance problem. 20 monutes later: captain announces the maintenance crew still hasn't arrived. 1+ hours later: finally leaves Philadelphia. Thankfully, we didn't have a connecting flight but I feel bad for the dozens of other people who did. I was already unsure about flying with United in the first place after hearing about other friends experiences. Now I understand where they are coming from. I don't care if it's typically a little cheaper compared to other airlines - I would never recommend this airline to anyone. Not worth it.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Rochester to Newark. I understand things happen, flights are delayed for safety purposes, I get it. But do not tell your customers they can't bring the standard purse and smaller carry on until they get to the airport and you trick them into paying $25 to check in their bag. I only realized this while in line using their terrible app trying to check in and avoid the line. Extremely poor user experience. This should be made clear to customers and shouldnt even be their new policy because there is plenty of room under a passengers seats and in the overhead bin. This almost caused me to miss my flight, i just made it. Once you leave a bad first impression like that, doesnt matter if your crew is friendly and services you well. You have now given me a negative perception of your airline and i will gladly pay more to fly with jetblue and american where i have had great experiences. You really expanding those profit margins per the few extra passengers getting tricked into paying $25 to check a bag?\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Atlanta. Never using united again! My flight was extremely delayed. There wan no flights to get me and my family to our destination the same day. We're on a layover until the next day extremely unacceptable. There was no refund given So we had to still take the flight or lose all the money I paid on tickets for my family one infant and 2 toddlers waiting days for a flight at the airport is unacceptable. I hate United and will never recommend to anyone.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Why does this airline exist? Worst experience, seats were filthy. The seat pockets had dirt in it, and service is usually bad. I went up to the customer help desk in Chicago to ask if I could jump on an earlier flight from Chicago to Cedar Rapids (I had a layover in Chicago). They told me the flight is full. When I mentioned there are tickets available on their website, I was told I can book it online then. While boarding the flight from Toronto, my carry-on bag was taken without my permission and checked-in. I am really speechless with the horrific experience. I am going to avoid United in future. Will pay few dollars extra for a better service.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Worst service ever!

Being charged an additional $25/way to carry on a bag on a United flight is a terrible way to get extra revenue for a company.

I feel taken advantage of and this will be the last time I ever fly United.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Well, let me start off by saying that I never made the trip with United Airlines since my flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles was cancelled the night before (roughly around 15 hour before departure time). I simply got a one-line message saying that my flight was cancelled due to aircraft maintenance. No apologies offered. I called the customer service to confirm this and \"uh huh\" was the only answer I got. Again, no apologies made. The customer rep\\'s attitude was extremely indifferent and just plain rude.

That was 1:30 in the afternoon on Monday and it is now Wednesday, late afternoon. I keep getting the \"run around\" giving me different answers every time I speak to someone.

Extremely Frustrated.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Portland to Austin . This trip was by far my worst experience flying and I fly pretty frequently for work. This trip started off by being diverted from Houston directly to Austin and having to sit 1.5 on the tarmac in a hot cabin. From there my luggage was lost and I had to have it shipped to my hotel missing my evening meeting I had arranged. On the way back I could not confirm my flight and I had to lose my original seating assignment flying into San Francisco. Now I'm in the SFO airport and I have been waiting since 430 for my flight but after three delays and three gate changes I am worried I will not even get home today. I haved use other airlines and never have this many screw ups. Dissatisfied and angry. Avoid booking with United at all costs.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Moline to Salt Lake City via Denver. I had a very unpleasant experience with United Airlines on September 18, 2017. I was told that because I was two minutes late, my seat was reassigned. It was unclear that I had to be at the gate 30 minutes prior to my departure and if I were late my seat would be reassigned. On my confirmation email, it clearly states that my seat will be automatically assigned prior to boarding and can\\'t be changed once they\\'re assigned. Thus, I had to take the next flight at 5AM. When I was on my flight the next morning, I asked the flight attendant if I could move two rows back because the plane was not to capacity and it would be more comfortable for both myself and the gentleman next to me. I was told by the flight attendant that, \"They had already made a count and that the weight distribution would be off\". Having flown previously, I\\'ve moved seats before with no issue. Because of these experiences, I don\\'t feel that United Airlines values their passengers and therefore, I will no longer book with them.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Rochester. The flight was very pleasant except for the rather disturbingly rude person who sat next to me. He was quite rude to the stewardess. I believe he was upset because it was a short flight and couldn't give him the amount of alcohol that he had hopped for. He fussed and decided to write very awful things about her. Dispite this the stewardess was very patient, calm, and kind. I find this very admirable, and just wanted to congratulate United on hiring such a resilient woman.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United has quickly become my least favorite airline. Upon my 2 day travel to Phoenix, I arrive to the airport with my purse and my backpack. I\\'m unable to carry on my backpack because \"that\\'s just the fare that I purchased.\" After asking when they implemented this new rule, the women replied, \"don\\'t argue with me ma\\'am.\" I was simply asking a question. As a woman, I should be able to carry a purse and a backpack onto a plane. Now, after careful planning, on my way home I now have to check my small 8 pound backpack and will be late for work in order to wait for it at my destination. These \"new rules\" were never clearly stated when I purchased my ticket. I also purchased 2 tickets under one credit card and they put my husband and I on opposite sides of the plane. United treats their basic economy class as lower individuals and I will never travel with them again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Worst service, worst flight, ran late and landed after our second flight was departing and no one tried to assist us! Will never fly with them again. Never had such an awful flying experience and as a business person I fly often. I would highly advise any airline is better than United if you want reliable helpful crew.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Boston to Shanghai via Chicago. It has been years since I flew United and I forgot how bad it is. They totally milk their ORD frequent flyers. Departure lounge is spare with no food or alcohol. The business class seat configuration is 8 seats across, barely wider than coach and less place for a bag than coach. Both flights took too more than an hour late with no explanation or apology. Flight attendants bark orders. Wi-Fi broken with no explanation or apology. Meal choice - forget it, only one left unless you're 100K in which case they will literally take the meal of another passenger for you. AC power outlet broken, so no charging for 15 hours. This is like a third world airline. For a $5,000 ticket this is shameful and a good reminder that not all seats are equal.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Orlando. Friendly skies more like lies in disguise. If you want to be nickle and dimed for an average flight that gives you cramps and where the people generally do not care about you or your business then United is the flight for you. You will be charged for every step along the way and don't expect staff to be friendly or helpful. In a market where other airlines go out of their way to ensure your comfort and to provide the best value for your travel I'm shocked that United still chooses to act the way it does.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Mexico City. The unfriendly skies. Flew with my 3 and 5 year old boys. They were not able to seat us together despite I asked when checking in and on the plane. The plane was not full. This is the first time an airline place my kids away from me. One kids fell sleep and the other came up to me on my middle seat. The guy next to me tried to help and moved one row forward to the emergency row so my boy could be next to me. Immediately a sour purser came and threw him back as the emergency row is a premium seat on United. I understand their policy but do think the purser could have helped. Lounge food is very low quality compared to Lufthansa or BA. We are gold and silver level on SA which seems to be only reason to fly United so you can board early and bring more luggage', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I purchased non-refundable round-trip tickets from Boston to San Francisco for my husband and myself to attend my dear cousin's funeral. A day before our scheduled departure, I canceled my husband's flight because he had a bad cold and was coughing too much to get on a plane. In my conversation with United, I was told how to file for a refund (even though my tickets were non-refundable). I traveled to San Francisco myself. The direct flight both ways went fine, but the return flight was remarkable. By chance, I ended up sitting next to my sister and brother-in-law who were returning to Boston from the same funeral. We chatted with one of the flight attendants who knew we were returning from a funeral. She was exceptionally kind and gave us complimentary snacks. Her kindness was greatly appreciated during our bereavement. After I returned home, I filled out the online Refund form to see about getting a refund for my husband's ticket. I explained that not only was he coughing too much to get on a plane for six hours but it would have been very inconsiderate to other passengers for him to be hacking away. United Airlines was kind enough to promptly issue a refund for my husband's unused round-trip fare - a full refund, not a credit for future travel. I appreciate the refund - the thought of having to pay for an unused round-trip ticket for a funeral would only add insult to injury. I am grateful to United Airlines for making a very unpleasant situation (me traveling across the country alone, without my husband, for my cousin's funeral) as comfortable and pleasant as they could.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I travel frequently and United consistently lacks in quality compared to American, Southwest and Frontier. The customer service here needs serious improvement, for example today I asked a flight attendant if there was any room left in overhead compartments for my carry on (even though this is still 7 minutes or so until boarding ends and all of the compartments had been closed early) very kindly and politely and the response was completely rude and dismissive to my question she told me \"that can comfortably fit under your seat, in the most condescending offensive tone\" well I am a 5\\'10\" woman whose knees already touch the seat in front of me and would like to be able to enjoy my flight. She acted like it was too much to ask and so I then had to be uncomfortable unnecessarily on a flight that I paid for. So instead of arguing about it, as it was not worth my time and energy I then said forget it and then just bitterly deal with it the rest of the flight. I am very disappointed with the quality of this service, it\\'s a Friday afternoon and the last thing anyone wants is to start their weekend feeling annoyed.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My daughter and I were flying business class from San Francisco to Boston on United night flight. We both had 2 bags weighing of which one was weighing 67lbs and the other ones 70lbs. Upon check in, someone who acted like the manager in charge helps us get the baggage tags from a machine and then put our bags on the scale. He told us they were overweight and that we had to pay for the extra lbs. We did not agree because we had weighed the bags before and they were good to go. An argument started and the man became very rude to us. Then we took the bags and put them on another counter scale and the weights were exactly like the ones we had measured ourselves before going to the airport. Then my daughter started taking pictures of the scales and suddenly another employee came to us and said \"don\\'t worry it\\'s ok you can go\"! Apparently, the company seems to use inaccurate scales to get some extra money from voyagers. This is unacceptable and I am filing a complaint with the company. My advice is that you weigh your bags before going to the airport and once there ask to double check on different scales.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Hong Kong. I only fly United because they dominate the Newark airport, which happens to be the closest to my home. To be fair though, and to set aside all my prior experiences I will review the flight from a fresh slate. The aircraft, a 17 year old 777 with the old Continental interior. There was personal in seat IFE but it was slow and unresponsive. The movies that were available were recent and best sellers. I was very happy to see that the drink cart was busted out maybe 4 times during the flight and about every hour there was an FA distributing water. Flight was only about 20 minutes. Food itself was a choice between western and asian meal. To be honest, none of the meals were good. But what kills me the most about United is the horrible customer service, flight attendants are all rude and cold. No matter how decent the actual flight may be, the FA's ruin the experience.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Atlanta to San Francisco. Staff were rude and unhelpful. It amazes me how you can wait for an hour to rebook a flight only to have the gate attendant look at the line and say \"we have other flights to deal with, if you were on the moved / delayed flight, take it somewhere else. We\\'re not dealing with any more of you.\" Made it to the next gate and had to convince that attendant just to check and see if I\\'d make a 10pm connection. Her answer was \"no\" and she seemed to think her job was complete. Waiting on hold and in lines for hours just to be told I won\\'t make it home. No effort whatsoever to actually rebook or solve the problem. Of course no compensation or hotel was offered after finally rebooking for the next morning after being on hold with United for almost an hour. Pay hundreds of dollars for a service, and they truly seem to have no to minimum interest in actually delivering that service to you.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Austin to Boston via Chicago. I booked these flights for me and my daughter to take her to college, so we had 4 checked bags between us, a carry on and personal bag. The flights were fine, left on time, and arrived early. No surprises with our seats, or food (we brought our own). On the way home, I even got to upgrade my seats, not all the way to first class, but at least closer to the front. The staff were all pleasant, so no complaints. However, a day after our arrival at our destination, my daughter called and asked if I had some of her underwear. I said no, they must have been left at home. She said no, that she remembered packing them. However, I wanted to wait until I got home to make sure that we hadn't just left them. When I got home 2 days later and they weren't there, I called United. I was told very rudely that because I hadn't called within 24 hours of the flight, I couldn't make a claim. I told him that I wasn't interested in monetary reparation, I just wanted to make the complaint to let them know that they had a pervert baggage handler somewhere. He was still rude and said that they couldn't do anything because I didn't call within 24 hours of the flight's arrival. Really?? No shock and horror at one of their employees stealing? United blew it at the last moment. No wonder so many people refuse to fly United, including 3 of my family members who fly all the time for work. Now I will join them in this boycott.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Washington to Chicago. This airline does not respect customers. My Washington inbound flight was delayed on Sep, 1st and now, Sep, 4th I am sitting for 3 hours in the boarding room waiting for guess what, another United delayed flight. Remark: Both cases caused by aircraft maintenance. Ground staff answer to questions about food was the best: \"Oh, Sure, we can provide water and some snacks\"! The pictures show the snacks and the quantity, it was a great exercise to get one for my wife and another for myself. Hoping for better regulations to make this business more serious. Thanks, United.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | London Heathrow to Chicago. I booked through Travelup and thought I was on an Air Brussels flight and I discover it was United Airlines one. At check in I was impressed by all the help while taken aback to be asked the address I was staying. I unfortunately gave them an old address out of my address book which I then had to somehow correct, the staff reassured me with address labels. The staff on the plane seemed older. I started to be unimpressed when I found myself sitting in a seat that had a yellow sticker on its arm indicating that the inflight entertainment would not work from that seat. The staff alerted technical support who confirmed this so I and other passengers were given the opportunity to sit in any other spare seat. What unimpressed me was the staff could not get the inflight entertainment to work for any of us, we were given the option of buying into their wifi service (about $25) which out of principle I was not going to do, especially when the staff commented it was a bit intermittent anyway and there was no way of recharging my ipad as there is no USB port at the seat. I asked if they had any magazines, no. As compensation we were, at the end of the journey, alerted to their online 'appreciation' service. This I duly filled in, however their site did not allo me to put in my uk county for my address so i had to lie to make the page move forward and say IL for Illinois where I am staying. Promptly I had an offer of $100 offered me towards another United Airlines flight to be used within a year, which is not something I will use.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to Indianapolis via Chicago. After sitting for 30 min on plane at the gate we were notified of a hydraulic leak seen by nose gear. We sat at gate on plane for almost an hour before finally being cleared. Our connecting flight was to leave Chicago at 12:15, there were about 8-10 of us just on this flight due to be on same connecting flight. We arrived and ran as fast as possible to get to the gate and got there at 12:06 and gate was already closed. Their delay in first place caused us to be late and yet they couldn't wait a few min for us to get there. Plane was still at gate, luggage still being loaded etc. so in a nutshell their plane leaving an hour late wasn't an issue but waiting 6-8 minutes for 8-10 passengers to arrive due to their issue late by 6 min wasn't good enough. United never again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to San Francisco. My trip with United was the worst experience ever. They have this new rule with no carry ons. We bought the tickets from expedia and we had no forewarning. At the check in kiosk we found out about this new rule. We checked in our carry on much to our annoyance about not receiving any previous warnings. At the gate my husband had his suit in a hanger and a backpack on him and the employees were rude and obnoxious before we even got a chance to talk. The employee immediately started baddegering us about receiving 17 alerts about no the more than one item per person rule. When we tried to explain we bought the ticket from expedia and didnt receive any warning, she went on to imply that we were lying! Another employee had to intervene and let us through (as if they were giving us a pass) This is ridiculous! Make an announcement if you are changing policies! When we entered the airplane was hot while we were being seated. No air! Till we took off for 40 minutes. This experience is the worst I have ever had and my family or I will never fly United ever again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Vancouver to Honolulu via San Francisco. Two flights each way to Hawaii, and on all 4 flights the film entertainment simply buffered beyond belief after 30 minutes and the wifi failed completely eventually. I would have been even more annoyed if I\\'d paid $9.99 to borrow a screen. On the last leg of the flight home, we persevered with a film and it took us 3 and a half hours to get through it!

Seat comfort was noticeably worse than anything I've flown domestically, and felt much more cramped than the Delta SFO-LAX I fly regularly.

Meal was tasty, a decent choice of entertainment, and staff was helpful. It wasn't stellar service but it fulfilled the minimum requirements. More importantly, on the way back we had to change planes when we were already seated because there was an electrical problem and United managed to prepare a replacement aircraft in just over 2 hours, which I found impressive.

Was told and shown that we all had seats together. This is very important considering we are flying with young children. We receive our boarding passes and see that all of us are separated. Uhm no. The lady at the gate was incredibly rude and seemed as if we were a bother, pretty sure it\\'s her job to help customers. She told us \"it\\'s ok, you are all near one another anyways so it\\'s not a big deal.\" Not a big deal? Excuse me! We board the plane, my 3 year old daughter who has never flown before has a seat between two adult males. I question one stewardess about this, she tells me, \"oh it\\'s fine she can sit there and you are back here and you\\'ll be able to see her.\" Well I don\\'t know about you but I\\'m pretty sure I can\\'t see through the bathrooms and around the corner! I then not so nicely told her that she must be losing her mind if she thinks I\\'m going to let my 3 year old daughter sit on an airplane for 2.5 hours in between two strangers and out of my eyesight. Her response, \"ma\\'am, you need to sit down in your assigned seats.\" and walked away. Attempting to control the anger that was bubbling up from my insides I found another stewardess who was able to help me and have people change seats so I could sit by my daughter. My sister had the same encounter with the same stewardess about her children. Absolutely ridiculous! What airline thinks it\\'s ok to place a small child alone between two strangers on an airplane? The employees at the concourse were rude and unhelpful. We had checked in online to save some time, not sure why because when we arrived we had to check in again at the kiosk. We were then told we were all TSA pre checked and to proceed to that area. Except, we weren\\'t. Only 2 of us were and those 2 were the 3 and 5 year old. Because that makes sense doesn\\'t it? Let\\'s send a 3 and 5 year old through security alone. So then after finding this out we then had to walk all the way back down to the \"regular\" security. Flight after all of this was uneventful. On our trip home we were delayed over 7 hours due to weather in Chicago. I can\\'t hold United accountable for this as I am a smart and rational person and realize they have 0 control over the weather. We were all given $15 vouchers to get food and drink while we waited for our flight. Which was great, except the vouchers didn\\'t work. For any of us on that flight. The computer system wouldn\\'t recognize the voucher and would lock up. So we were not able to get those over priced $12 chicken strips. I was unimpressed with this airline. Horrible customer service. Horrible employees. Horrible experience. We will never fly United again. Ever.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United twice in past 2 years and both trips were at least 2,000 miles and both were non discounted fares - for 2 passengers. I paid for premium economy because I am tall, long legs and the airlines keep adding rows now and again to squeeze more cattle aboard. You see, I am discriminated against because I am tall. I cannot shorten my legs so I am forced to purchase premium seating now. Each of these 2 flights required connections, the connecting flights were cancelled so we had to spend 7 hours and 8 hours - respectively - sitting in connecting city airports. Since the flights were canceled for mechanical or flight crew issues, there was nothing to be done. I waited in line at customer service but United Customer Service told me I was in the wrong place to file a complaint! So I complained online and I was sent a measly $100 voucher - which I won't be using, since I will never fly United again. I was United premier several times and Delta Million Miler and have flown extensively for the past 35 years. I will fly other airlines or drive but I am finished with United.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Charlotte to Bozeman via Denver. We were treated very poorly from the beginning. From the moment we checked in on 18 August at 7am we were told our plane had mechanical issues but go ahead and check in. Every few hours we were told that it wouldn't be long. After half the day at the airport we were told to book another flight. Lines after lines at the United podium we were told that it would not be much longer, couldn't get another flight. After 10 hours of waiting at the airport we finally got notice that our original plane was about to approach. Then we found out that they had switched my ticket to another plane than my husbands. We booked out first class tickets together with seats next to each other. After more long lines we finally got them to put on the same flight but they did not put us sitting together. We were supposed to be in Bozeman, Mt at 1pm but finally after all of United's fiasco we arrived at 11pm and missing one of our bags that was checked. It arrived 4pm the next day. Everyone associated with this airline is a joke!\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Our United Airlines flight home from New Mexico to Florida got cancelled due to the weather. I called in to try to change it to a new flight at a different airport or on a different day. The system told me \"press 1 to receive a call back or stay on the line to wait.\" I didn\\'t press any buttons and I planned to wait, but their automated system said \"great, we\\'ll give you a call back\" and the call was ended. So I waited 50 minutes and never got a call. I am trying to call again now. This time it didn\\'t give me the option of a call back. It just said it\\'ll be over 30 minutes and hold music began playing. I have now been on hold for an hour and 34 minutes. I\\'m still waiting for someone to answer this phone and have no idea how much longer it\\'ll take. I cannot stand when companies don\\'t have enough staff at their overseas call centers. I flew once with United in July (that was my first time ever flying with them) and my flight got cancelled then too. I\\'ve flown American, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta and have never had a flight cancelled in my life. Flew twice with United (once in July, once in August) and both times they\\'ve been cancelled. And it\\'s impossible to get anyone on the phone. Safe to say I will be avoiding United for the rest of my life. Two absolutely terrible experiences.', \"united airlines Detroit to Chicago. This company has been the absolute worst. On my way from Boise Idaho to Detroit MI I was delayed two hours which caused a missed connection and what should've been 6 hours in the airport turned to 16 hours. Not only this I pretty much had to fight to get an earlier landing flight in Detroit so I wouldn't miss my best friends wedding (that I was standing in). Of course that put a sour taste in my mouth and as I attempt to leave today I was advised (an hour and a half before the flight was supposed to leave) the flight would be delayed for 2 hours. I am missing my connecting flight and will have to spend an entire day/night in the airport, miss work, and be completely miserable. This being the end of my trip I have absolutely no clean clothes and being a student I have no extra money for food and those sort of expenses. I will never fly this airline again. I would rather pay $400 extra through Delta or Alaska Airlines than fly through United again. They don't know how to orchestrate their staff or airplanes obviously and this extra added stress was not worth the $50 savings compared to Delta.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Birmingham to Los Angeles. Disappointing and lying customer service. While in the middle of a wedding ceremony, I was notified by text that our flight has been cancelled. I waited 1 hour 45 min on customer service (after pre-recording said it would be 30 min) to have our seats changed so we could sit together. We received our boarding passes minutes later only to learn the seats had not changed. Do not tell me that something has been taken care of in order to get me off the phone and make your job \"easier\". I would have respected the truth much more than this lack of integrity. It\\'s a shame that this was my last impression of United. They re-routed me out of Houston during the hurricane and did a great job with that call. I will avoid United in the future as it is apparent that they continue digging their own grave and are often times deserving of their poor reputation.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I booked a flight for my boyfriend for September 2nd from Newark to Orlando for $79. However, this morning, I received an email saying that I received a refund for the flight, which I never requested. I requested to have a different flight cancelled, but I have yet to receive confirmation of this. Upon calling United, we were told that there was nothing they could do about the flight they wrongfully cancelled, that he could not get onto the flight. No answer wasn't provided as to why I received a refund or how it was even requested. The representative could not answer any of our questions. However, the flight is still available, but for $110! We are truly baffled by and disgusted by this experience with United Airlines. Neither of us will be flying with United again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Denver. I called to try to resolve an issue with my name change and my miles and was transferred to four different people over the course of 45 minutes before it was then only partially resolved. The first person literally couldn't even understand the simple issue I was raising. On the fourth person who was a supervisor, I asked to check on my seat assignment and was told I had to be transferred to yet another person. I waited 30 minutes to talk to that person, with no option for a call back like the other airlines offer, only to be told that they could not change my seat to an aisle or a middle seat without a $160 fee. Almost half of the economy seats were economy plus, so even though they were available, they could not be assigned to ticketed passengers. I fly 15-20 times per year, mostly on American, Southwest and Delta. I have had pleasant experiences with all of these airlines. Never have I dealt with an airline with such incompetent rude staff only to have that conversation end with an explanation of a bad policy that I should have been able to get from the first - or even the 5th - person I talked to. This will be the second time flying United this year. I will never choose United again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Honolulu to San Diego. United is the worst airline. I got delayed and stuck in Oahu coming to and going back home to San Diego. Venturing to Oahu, both connecting flights were delayed and I missed my plane going to Lanai. And was stuck in Oahu. But at least I had my luggage. But was not offered a hotel or anything. However, the venture back home, they wouldn't let me onto the flight despite having a seat and confirmation number. Since I bought through expedia they were having issues giving me a paper ticket. I missed my flight and was stuck on Oahu with only my backpack and the clothes on my back. My suitcase made it home before I did. I didnt get a voucher or any accommodation. And Missed a day of work. Dont fly on united even if it is cheap. Fly Hawaiian if you travel to Hawaii. They have better customer service\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Me and 2 friends were flying to Yellowstone for a vacation. First of all, there shouldn\\'t be a 35 minute layover in the Houston airport as an option. My bag had to be courtesy checked in Charleston, so when I landed in Houston, I had to wait 10 minutes for my bag. We ended up having 10 minutes until the gate closed for our next flight. We ran (I kid you not) 0.7 miles across the airport from gate B to E. When we got to the gate (we made it 2 minutes after the gate closed), they said they could only let 1 of us on. When I asked why, the lady hesitated and said they couldn\\'t let anyone in the gate after it closed. But she let one of us on, so that made no sense. Found out they gave our other 2 seats away. Wouldn\\'t they know we had a connecting flight that was tight on a layover time? Well, we went to customer service and she says \"You had 8 minutes to get to your gate. Did you get lost?\" Are you kidding me? She wouldn\\'t comp us a hotel or anything. Said they weren\\'t liable. She couldn\\'t get us on any flights until the following day at 11pm. Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn\\'t they do this on the way there? The next morning, our flight from Houston to Charleston was delayed an hour. I have never in my life experienced so many flight issues as I did for this trip. Our travel experience was awful, and if United would at least compensate for some of that ridiculous amount of extra money we spent, I would be way happier right now. Will never fly United Airlines again.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Knoxville via Houston. No wonder United is getting such a bad reputation. I booked my flight months ago so I could be in Knoxville during the eclipse. My flight leaving Seattle was delayed causing me to miss my connection in Houston. I was originally supposed to arrive in Knoxville at 10:34 am. Now I'm not going to get there until closer to 5:00pm causing me to miss the eclipse. I was told United couldn't book me on another flight because I had a economy ticket. I paid over $500 for my ticket. I will never fly United again. Not one apology!\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | It was my first time to fly with United from Tokyo to Washington DC and after the bad press they've been receiving, I was a little nervous. Overall, it was a poor to average experience. On the ground (US side) their staff can definitely be better trained. I'm a vegetarian so I requested a special meal - probably the worst airplane food I've ever had. Don't bother requesting the vegetarian meal and just risk the regular food service where they usually have a meatless pasta/noodle option. The seats in premium economy have a good amount of legroom and the entertainment on board isn't bad either. I think my biggest issue with the experience overall was the disinterest of the flight attendants. After being repeatedly hit by the cart going by and the patronizing tone the FAs used when giving me the veggie meal, it makes you wonder how they continue to use their 'friendly skies' pitch. One of the flight attendants was really helpful though he was helping from the first class cabin.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Absolutely the worst travel experience I have ever had both ways with United. 14 people were not able to board the plane, it sat there for at least a half hour while we all tried to convince the staff to let us on, but our connecting flight was delayed so they could load three people long after the departure time. Our return flight the flight attendants were very rude and skipped over multiple people when handing out snacks and drinks, our final connecting flight home was delayed 45 minutes because they were waiting for a flight attendant to arrive. How is any of this good business practices. The absolute worst!', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. Took my kids for their first plane trip. Wanted them to have a good view, seating chart (Embraer 175) showed our selected seats in front of wing (row 11). Got on plane and guess what, over the wing! Needless to say they strained their necks the whole flight trying to see things out the window. The seats are very uncomfortable, hard as plastic, comparable to a city bus. I've flow other airlines, and never expected the level of discomfort I found in this plane. Will not fly United again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to Heathrow via Washington. The only problems that I encountered was severe weather which delayed are flight by 40 mins but they turned the plane around very quickly. Even after the delay I still didn't miss my connection, the second thing was the food on my flight back to London, it wasn't the best but then it wasn't horrible. On both flights the ground staff were helpful and informative, also on both flight the seats were cushioned and had a lot of hip room. The cabin crew on both flights were funny, helpful and informative. The inflight entertainment has a ton of stuff. The wifi was easy to access and has good connectivity. The food and beverages are good but personally I think pasta and mushrooms aren't the best mix. Overall very good value for your money.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Phoenix to Syracuse via Newark. I purchased my ticket a month before my departure date. I got to the airport and everything was fine. I paid for my carry on bags and got on the plane. We ended up having to land the plane in Atlanta because of weather. The staff told us we should only have a few hours layover and be back up in the air. A few hours passed by and we were told to board the plane. We all got on and sat for 30 minutes then we're told to get back off because there was no pilot. That itself annoyed me because it's a waste of time. We were told we had to stay in Atlanta. They gave me my carry on bag because everything I needed was in it and since I was going to be stuck in the airport over night I wanted to brush my teeth and use deodorant and have my phone charger to charge my phone. After the staff gave me my carry on bags. I was told I'd have to pay the baggage fee again. This delay and overnight stay in the airport is not my problem and I didn't feel like I should have to pay for my bag again. Ridiculous. I told the staff is there anyway they could accommodate for unexpected food and bag fee to wave it and maybe give me a voucher for food. I was told by all the staff that because I was a solo traveler, that they would not make any exceptions for me and told me they have more important things to deal with. I explained to them that my bank had locked my card because I tried to use it in the airport so I had no money and it was to late to contact my bank. The only cash I had on me had to go towards this carry on bag fee. The staff told me they could not help me and I needed to go find a spot to relax until the next plane had a seat for me. I am extremely upset with the carry on bag fees, the staff were very rude not only to me but everyone. I am upset that we had to sleep in the airport over night with no food or drinks offered to us. No blankets and they charged me another carry on bag fee because I needed my bag due to being stuck in the airport. I will never fly with United Airlines again. Extremely rude staff have no sympathy for people at all.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Burbank via San Francisco booked for November 2017. The customer service I have received through this company has been nothing but terrible. While on the phone with them they were very rude and couldn't give me any alternate options or help. They only told me to contact costumer service via email. They didn't provide me with an email address and I couldn't find one on the site so I had to use an outside source to find the email. When I contacted via email it took them two weeks to write back to me and another week to reply to my response just to tell me that they couldn't help me at all. This is highly inappropriate. If you wish to run a business then make sure your agents are trained to solve all problems and trained to actually respond to costumers in a timely manner. I also want to add that the website never works and is beyond difficult to navigate. I am beyond upset with the service I was given and I plan to never fly United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | We had a flight from Washington to LAX, aircraft had problems, they asked us to deboard. Little by little a 20 minutes delay turned in to a 5 hours. End of 5 hours they send passengers scrambling. Today again, on my flight from New York La Guardia to Washington, aircraft was disabled. A 15 minutes delay turned to hours of delay while waiting for parts to fix the flight. Sending passengers scrambling again. United staff were so un accommodating and mean, made me feel like it was my fault the flight got issues. Horrible experience. Will not fly United again!', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to Santa Rosa. The flight got delayed due to awaiting aircraft. Fine. After hours of waiting, we finally get onto the flight, sat for another hour on the plane and were told the flight got cancelled. Got back to the airport customer service and it is 9:00 PM (another hour wasted in the waiting line for so called \"compensation\") and asking for the next flight to get to Santa Rosa, got the boarding pass then got told you have to get your own hotel room. Now I am still in San Francisco, paying out of my own pocket for a hotel room simply because and I quote \"United policy says if (the delay or cancellation) it is due to weather, there is nothing we can do\" Even though, there is no rain no fog or whatever in San Francisco area at all, and Santa Rosa is right next to it! Come on UA you can do way better than this! When you cancel the flight you should think about consequences instead of throwing your customer out of the flight like trash.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United is terrible. Boycott them for their plane delays, terrible front desk service, and general disdain for passengers. Sat and sitting in the SFO Terminal 3 waiting for 4 hours while they constantly switched our gates around and changed the departing times probably 12-15 times. Absolutely horrendous. They need a huge change up. Will gladly pay more to fly other airlines in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Having not chosen to fry the friendly skies with the unfriendly United Airlines I now remember why. Had booked a flight to South Bend Indiana from Toronto via Chicago. Received a text indicating my outbound flight from Toronto was being delayed. The text did not mention I would miss my connection. Luckily I figured this out myself. Not that difficult. Called to re-book and the utterly useless staff members only suggestion was to spend the night in Chicago or leave the next day. I was able to find an alternate route. Toronto/Cleveland/Chicago/South Bend. There was availability on an Air Canada outbound to Chicago but she would not consider this. As time was becoming of the essence and I did not want to miss the possible flight, no time to argue. As it turned out the text message I received was wrong and I would have been able to make my connection. How do I know this? When my Cleveland to Chicago route was delayed I had plenty of time to check Fligthtracker. When I showed this to the agent in Cleveland he said the United Text system is often wrong and in future I should call. Really? Well the good news is I made all my connections. The bad news no bag. The very helpful agent in South Bend advised he had located my bag in Chicago and it would out in the first flight in the morning. He may have been very helpful but not truthful. Woke up this morning. The text message from United said still looking for the bag as did the website. Called the lost baggage number provided, their lost baggage centre is located in India so there were obvious communication difficulties. Not her fault but took about 20 minutes for her to tell me that though the bag was last scanned in Chicago there was no information as to where the bag was.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I purchased a ticket from the United Airlines counter at George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Friday afternoon, August 11 2017. I purchased this ticket from a United Airlines ticketing agent. I was assigned seat 21C on flight 1789 leaving at 7.25pm. I was at the gate 2 hours before the flight departed. We boarded the flight, sat in my assigned seat 21C and settled in for the flight home. Suddenly a gate agent boarded the flight and asked me to gather my belongings and exit the flight, this happened without any explanation, I was embarrassed in front of many passengers and told to deplane the aircraft. I was brought to customer services were they finally provided some poor answer that their agent mistakenly did not finish the ticket purchase and that I would not be allowed on their flight. Very rudely their customer service personal basically said we will do you a favor and not charge the $50 rebooking fee, here is a ticket for tomorrow. I requested my bag and they told me it had left with the airplane that I didn't have a ticket for. The most pathetic excuse of an airline I have ever experienced.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Overall, United Airlines economy service is ok from Los Angeles to Melbourne, seats comfortable enough, food ok, entertainment good but the staff are horrendous. They are loud, bossy, burnt out and just plain rude. They seem only to be able to manage the absolute minimum of words necessary to convey the intended message, for example, \"Eggs or French toast?\" Yelled at you in military style, then when somebody dared to ask a question, the staff member replied \"Just Choose,\" then continued with, \"that wasn\\'t so hard now, was it?\" Clearly they have forgotten that it is their chosen profession to provide a service and that the general expectation from that service is that it requires a certain amount professionalism, diplomacy, helpfulness and even some basic pleasantries wouldn\\'t go astray. It\\'s really not very nice having your food practically thrown at you. The passenger on the window seat of my row had her sandwich tossed in such a manner that it fell on the floor and she had to scramble around under her seat in the dark to retrieve it, disgusting! I would suggest retraining or maybe a pay rise for inspiration!', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United has to be the worst airline I have ever flown on. Flew Santa Ana to Newark. It was more than an hour late going to my destination. Coming home, first it was delayed, then delayed again, then the flight was canceled. A true nightmare. I had paid extra money so that my minor son could sit with me. Because they had to put us on another flight, there were no seats together. Would they refund the extra $50.00 that I paid. No way. The service was terrible. I highly recommend choosing another airline.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Detroit to Reno via Denver. United Airlines was the most unorganized airline I have ever flown on. They didn't provide good customer service on or off the ground. We arrived well over 3 hours for a domestic flight and no one kept us informed if we would make the flight or not due to the computer problems they were having and could not print tickets. This is understandable but to pick people who were yelling and causing the most commotion as opposed to calming veryone down letting all passengers know that the flight crew is aware of the problem and no one would be missing their flight. When i would try and ask questions i was dismissed without answers and they were rude. Leaving the trip had a horrible experience with them as well. Again we allowed ourselves plenty of time especially after our first encounter with them. We again waited in line for hours when we finally approached the desk They only let 2 of us check our bags. The other 2 family members they refused to allow them on and had them fly out later that night. I have never encountered such an uncompassionate and unorginized company. I will never fly them again even if the flight is free.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | 3 out of 4 of our United flights from Dallas to Salt Lake City via Houston return were delayed and one ultimately cancelled due to 'operational/staffing' issues. We were told for two of the flights that the Captian 'didn't show up'. We were rerouted, delayed and put on stand by. We ended up with an extra 10 hours of time spent waiting. In the end, we rented a car and drove 7 hours from the airport just to get home so we could make it to work.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Tokyo to Toronto via Chicago. The food was good for the long flight from Tokyo. Standard. My complaint is that I was not given a choice due to being in economy class as they ran out of the other choice. I guess that's what I get for being poor. The flights were mainly on time, but they were delayed a bit due to things that were out of control. Otherwise, it was reasonable. Customer service was standard and expected. The staff was efficient and friendly enough and were able to answer my questions. They lost my luggage and I was disappointed. But I was able to get my luggage back delivered the next day and the help desk was nice and friendly. Standard amenities, the blankets were thin and did not keep me warm, no extras but for the price, I did not expect any extras. They were the cheapest airline. Overall it was a good experience, standard and I'm happy I got my bag back so quickly.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Berlin. I was excited to be on one of the first Polaris flights but turned out to be a total disappointment. First of all, United serves Champagne in plastic glasses - Plastic? The food was not great and the cabin layout neither. All in all not a good business class. The wines though were good.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Chicago to Bay City. This is worse than terrible. United does not offer First on these flights. You are squeezed into small planes. The bored stewardess walkes down the plane once to check that the belts are on.

We spent 8 hours at the airport while they tried to get the plane going - it was clear while we onboard the engines didn't turn over properly and no air conditioning was working .

We were on the next day departure and they took our plane to give to another route and then we had to wait now for another 3 hours while this farce continues. United - this is disgusting. Enough is enough and I will never fly United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Atlanta to Newark. I am a mileage plus member and I paid my ticket through my card in order to avoid the check in fee. When I approached the customer service at airport, they made me pay for the bag as their system has incorrect expiration date of my mileage plus card. Very disappointing. After I reached my destination, it seems my bags never left Atlanta and they said I would get my bags by next day afternoon. After 24 hours they has still not located where my bag was. We were in the same clothes for two days. And since this was a holiday for a short time we ended up spending most of our time indoor rather than touring NYC worrying about our bag since we had everything in the checkin bag. I have had another very dissatisfied experience with united. Strongly recommend against flying united.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Denver to Tampa. The passengers were boarded two times - one on a defective plane, second with pilots who expired their flight time. The flight was supposed to take off at 5:45 and it is 9:39 and now we are again at the gate waiting for a fresh crew. The flight attendants did not bother to provide us with water even if we stayed in the plane for over an hour. I had to ask for water.

Absolutely awful expirwnce. Flew back from DC at 6 am. Was required to get my carry on bag checked, and pay the money. Then the staff in the plane was very rude. Arrived at my stop in New Jersey. Confusing airport, but made it to my gate. They said the flight was on time, but we were not going to board yet. I went up and asked the guy st the desk if he knew the boarding time. He literally said \"sit down, I\\'ll make the announcement when I do\". Got on the plane after a uninformed hour delay. Didn\\'t take off for another hour, of just sitting on the plane.

I intend to post to this site every time I fly United.

I only fly a few times a year, when I do, I confirm First class. I have a wide rump, so I pay for the extra room. This trip, United Airlines chose to change the aircraft, resulting in me getting bumped from First to Economy, even though I paid for First. They would only provide $250 for the forced move to Economy, which is less than I paid for the difference between the two classes. I can only assume that the original aircraft was not oversold... they downgraded the size plane, so they wouldn't have any unsold seats. United Airlines will forever be at the bottom. No more chances.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | London Heathrow to San Francisco. Not sure how this airline still exists in modern days. The least you can offer is proper entertainment on an 11 hour flight. The only entertainment is connecting your own device (mobile, tablet or laptop) to their wifi. Now, imagine this: 300+ passengers trying to connect to the same wifi at once. I had to wait until they served the meals and everyone was busy eating to be able to connect. I have to say, later during the flight it was better, but i guess because most people were bored from trying and just went to sleep. I am not a tall person, and I never notice leg room, but not on this flight. It is noticeably crammed. Seats are old and torn in places. I unfolded the tray and seat in front was torn. They provide electrical sockets under the seat. However, due to short leg room, it is very hard to plug anything in, and to even keep it without knocking it out. Food is a disaster. Lame and old, and not properly packaged. It was just wrapped in a plastic sheet, not sealed. The quantity is small. I was never hungry at the end of a flight like this one.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Will never fly with United again. Flew Chicago to Indianapolis. Was told at the terminal that there would be a slight delay due to cleaning and maintenance of the plane. Once this was \"completed\" all passengers boarded the plane. Then to find out there was still an issue. The service crew was called by the captain and they either ignored or blew off the call several times. We have been sitting on the plane for almost 3 hours, and are still waiting. This is utterly ridiculous. It is causing people to miss connecting flights and delaying others arrival home.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Fly United about three to four times a month for the last two years and I cannot recall the last time my departing flight left on time. Maintenance, computer problems, crew issues, inbound aircraft issues, or flight queue problems seem to always lead to a delay.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | London Heathrow to Newark on a morning flight and really enjoyed the experience. We were supplied with drinks and hot food, and had a great selection of entertainment whilst being able to charge our phones & laptops. The staff didn't keep trying to flog us duty free goods which is always a bonus. However our return journey on 18th July wasn't so good. Poor entertainment with very limited choice and screens the size of postage stamps with no device charging facilities. Not everyone wants to sleep on a night flight. Also the hot meal was dreadful. Slimy cheesy sauce with horrible wilted spinach and some substance masquerading as chicken. These minor gripes aside, I would fly United again - just not on a night flight. Much better facilities & entertainment on the day flight which was an all round more enjoyable experience.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | We flew United Airlines from Seattle, WA to Newark, NJ on July 1, and from there we were to have a connecting flight to Norfolk, VA. Originally our route was supposed to be Seattle - Chicago - Norfolk, but a day or two before our flight United changed the route to go through Newark instead. We arrived in Newark with no mishaps and when we went to a United counter to see what gate our connecting flight was leaving from, we were told that flight had been cancelled, but no reason was given. Instead, we were directed to a customer service counter with a very long line and only two agents assisting customers. Come to find out, United cancelled several flights from Newark that day. After standing in line for almost two hours (while also trying to talk to a person on the United hotline number while in line and receiving no help), it was finally my turn to speak to a desk agent. The agent was no help at all, and told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and since it was a weather issue, he told me United was not responsible to help with lodging, rental cars, etc. The soonest we could be booked on another flight was the following Monday, July 3. His solution was my family of four was welcome to remain in the airport throughout the weekend. That being an unacceptable option we, and apparently every other United customer affected by cancellations, went to rent a car and finally found a car available to drive to Norfolk. After cancelling our flight, the best they can offer is for us to stay in the airport for two nights and three days? No offer to reimburse, no offer to help with the rental, not offer to reimburse baggage fees. Not even some empathy form the agent. Not flying United again. And after relaying my experience to family and friends, neither are any of them.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Hong Kong. I am positive this was my last flight with United. Flight attendants had \"I hate my job attitude\". One gave a sarcastic remark when I asked if she still had the same drink available. They served 2 small meals that were over 10 hours apart with a snack in between. The snack was a small sandwich that was smaller than your palm and a mini bag of M&Ms so you feel hungry for most of the flight. Whole atmosphere was unpleasant - dirty bathrooms, uncomfortable seats, unhappy crews. I was hesitant to choose United but gave it a try because of cheap fare and my prediction was accurate. The entertainment screen was small and not in good working order.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Pittsburgh to Orlando via Washington. Traveling with a legit (60lbs) service dog and notified the airline 45 days in advance. Told me they was seating me where the service dog would have ample room not to effect other passengers. On day of flight we load the plane and in the smallest area on plane squeezed in with another passenger. Guess that's what I guess for being conciderate and letting them know well in advance. Staff seemed like they could care less. Last flight with this airline.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Upon approaching the customer service representative in order to upgrade my ticket to Business for my flight from Zurich to Washington, the rep was rude, abrupt, curt, and completely inattentive. I am a nurse and was landing in IAD directly going to work for my night shift. All I wanted to do was rest. I had explained that to the rep who didn't seem to really care at all. At that moment of contact with that Rep I chose to not upgrade as I felt that United does not invest the money that I would have spent to train its employees but rather allow them to get away with treating the passengers in an ugly manner. The rest of the reps at that station were no better. Every single one of the customers at the desk (total of 8), walked away grouchy and angry and I cannot blame them. I am severely disappointed especially given the ugly reviews of United as of late, thinking that more effort has been put into better customer service. This may be the very last time I fly United unfortunately as I would much prefer to support an American airline but not at this cost.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Shanghai. I was enroute to my wedding and their first craft was gate swapped with another. We had to deplane and move to a different gate and after getting on the new plane it just stopped there for hours. By the time we left it was 4 hours late. I asked if they could call the gate to hold my connecting flight since I can make it. All I need was 15 minutes. None of them cared. None of the flight attendent was willing to help. They are also a bunch of racist scums that sarcastically told me that I better run to my connecting flight across the airport. So if you wanna be treated like this then fly with UA. For me I'd rather fly with another, even if I have to pay more.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Chicago, Customer service is the worst. They're so rude. Had a small carry on from BNA - LAX, fine. From LAX - SEA, fine. On the way back from SEA to LAX, apparently it was too big and a $65 charge.

Hate this airline, will never fly it again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Portland via San Francisco. United Airlines has the absolute worst customer service.

They made a vacation into a stress filled week.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to San Francisco. Worst flight service ever! They are extremely unprepared. We got into the flight and the flight started moving at 6am which was the original departure time. After 5 min they realize that there were aircraft issues. They had no idea how long the issue was going to take to resolve. The staff were very rude and not at all helpful. The flight finally started left 3 hrs later! Never again United.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Never again with United. Unreliable, unpredictable, unapologetic, and uncaring. I was originally supposed to depart from Rochester at 10:15am, stopover in Chicago, and then connect to Madison, but my flight from Rochester was delayed for an and hour and a half due to mechanical issues, causing me to miss my fight at ORD, which they resassigned me to a 3:50pm flight which is now delayed for an hour and a half. I was supposed to arrive in Madison by 1:30pm and now I won't get in until after 6pm. The entire point of my trip was to surprise my older sister at a dinner before she leaves for Indonesia for two years, and I now I won't even make it.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Miami. You would think after everything going on with United lately, they\\'d get their act together but they still suck just as much. I had a flight this morning which was cancelled due to \"weather\" even though there are flights before and after that one that are still on. I was told it was probably due to weather elsewhere and so they couldn\\'t get their crew or airplane here. They send me a message at 2am and my flight was at 10. I call and the wait is over 45 minutes. I only had the option to reschedule for 7 am and I was about an hour from the airport. I saw this message when I woke up and rushed to the airport. I actually had plenty of time to make the flight but I was told to make a line for about 45 minutes, even though I told the United Airlines employee that helped me that my flight was cancelled and I was on another one which departed in about an hour. After making that line I was redirected to a second one that took no less than 20 minutes. So, by the time I actually got to speak to someone, that flight was no longer an option. I asked her if she could send me on another airline (I know they can do that when they screw up) and she said no because it was due to weather. As if it was due to weather where I was at or as if them being so slow and having such long lines was also a weather issue. I am now on standby for a flight at 2pm which she told me I probably won\\'t be able to get on because it\\'s fully booked and there\\'s nothing else available until tomorrow. Nice one United!', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I traveled with United from Nashville to Boston via Chicago on Monday July 17, 2017 and back on July 21, 2017.

This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Don't fly with them!\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Boston via Chicago. Will give United Airlines a -1 star rating.

When I flew with Delta to Boston, they sent me and email to confirm the night before and everything was efficient. Here, there was no email and they forced me to pay $25 for a small carry on bag. The airline staff were extremely rude. Should have looked at their past lack of customer service.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Orlando to Calgary via Denver. I\\'ve been to more than 25 countries, flying with many different airlines over the world and United Airlines is for sure the worst one I have ever been with. In 5 days a flight was cancelled, our bags got lost, other flight was late, making me lose a connection flight and making me stay one night in the connection city. They didn\\'t even want to give us a hotel voucher because it \"was not their fault\". Most of the company workers treat customers horribly with bad manners and being rude, with some rare exceptions. The workers are never there to help you. When you ask for their help for ticketing or luggage issues they simply say: \"There is nothing we can do\". United Airlines managed to mess up me and my family\\'s vacation in a few days. So my recommendation: Never fly with this horrible airline. Oh, and a small detail: mine and my whole family\\'s tickets were for Business Class, and you still receive that poor kind of treatment. And when they change our flights, they put us on economy class. Such a joke.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Providence. United Airlines is the worst airline in America. Two years ago I flew them and they delayed and cancelled my flight, after 7 hours of promising we'd get off the ground. United Airlines string you along in the hopes that no one asks for a refund. No regard for their customers, they should just be honest so that people can make arrangements early. Flew them again (no other flights ) last week, and low and behold, the same thing happened again. Fool me once I guess. On top of that, their staff was incredibly rude and dismissive. Terrible airline, avoid at all costs.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Cleveland to Washington. This was the absolute worst trip of my life. This airline doesn't allow you to take a carry on larger than a backpack, so I had to check my small suitcase that any other airline would consider a carry on. My flight that was supposed to leave at 1:00pm was delayed 11 times and cancelled once. When I was finally able to fly out it was 10 pm. When I arrived in Washington I was told that they had left my luggage back in Cleveland and it would not arrive until 11 am the next morning. This was a problem because I had a meeting at 10 am the next morning. United said they would update me about my luggage, but they never did. I called at 11, when my luggage was supposed to arrive and they told me they would deliver it to my hotel in 6-7 hours. Needless to say I drove back to the airport to pick the luggage up myself. The entire trip I encountered rude and incompetent staff who seemed unwilling to perform the job they had been hired to do. I will never fly United again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines is consistently 2 to 4 hours late. Every gate that I passed today was delayed for no apparent reason other than what seems to be business as usual. Then they have the nerve of creating this Basic Economy class that limits you from taking on a normal carry on so they can charge you an extra $25 each way to check what would normally be a regular carry on. Today, before my flight from Asheville to Newark I passed numerous empty seats and overhead bins and sat on my 3.5 hour delayed flight. I will avoid United at all costs.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Charlotte to Toronto via Washington. The worst customer service I have ever experienced, no regards to the customers time and concerns, not punctual, unfriendly staff. Disgusted with their services, and I will never book flights with them. They don't provide any kind of compensation for flight cancellations, not even a room. We had to spend the night in the airport.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Kansas City to Hartford via Chicago. My flight (#1936) from Chicago to Hartford was supposed to depart at 9:17 on July 17th, 2017, and arrive in Hartford at 12:30 am on the 18th. Before arriving at O\\'Hare, many passengers had received multiple texts/emails stating the flight was to be delayed with significant fluctuations in the delay time with each message. After everyone had waited at the gate for 2+ hours, we were told that the flight was to be cancelled because there was simply \"no crew.\" The manager thought it was a proper compensation to just give $10 meal vouchers to the passengers and then told us to all get in a line for customer service. Almost all the passengers, including myself, waited in line for over an hour, being told that perhaps we could get a hotel room courtesy of United until the next flight out that wasn\\'t already overbooked, which made many for around 9:20 PM almost 24 hours later than the original flight. As we were standing in line, an employee gave us papers telling us to call a customer service number that might be able to help us out, which had the majority of us on hold for 15+ minutes. When I was finally able to speak to a representative, the conversation was unhelpful as there was seemingly nothing that could be done. As the end of the line reached the desk, we were told that the hotels that United could offer rooms in were booked up and that they couldn\\'t offer us that either. I managed to get on a flight out at 6 AM on the 17th as part of a standby with a few other passengers- out of the fully booked flight that needed to be in Hartford 6 hours prior. Overall the experience was disgustingly unprofessional on behalf of United Airlines, and I wouldn\\'t fly with them again, even if I was paid to.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Atlanta to Sacramento via Chicago. My wife and three children are flying United today cross country today. Three kids, two boys 12 and 9, and my 6 year old daughter. United refuses to sit them all together, making my 6 year old daughter sit by herself with strangers unless my wife can convince people to move. Will never waste another $ on them. Unfortunately they've clearly already done that math and don't care. I'll give them a 1 out of 10 for being on time.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Albany. This airline has no regard for customer service and are rude to their customers. I'm waiting an extra 7 hours for my flight with no compensation because they don't care. This seems to be happening time and time again with this airline. Can't say I will fly with them again. Very disappointed with the customer service. The flight attendant on my connecting flight looked like he had just rolled out of bed and didn't even come around to offer drinks or collect trash. Customer service was disrespectful and did not help at all.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Baltimore to San Diego via Los Angeles. Worst experience I've had. I will never fly with United Airlines again. Every flight was delayed by hours. 10 hours in total. Staff are unfriendly and rude. Still waiting on a refund. Totally and completely unprofessional.

I have no words to explain how terrible this was, but they'll never see me again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I have been traveling for quite some time and United Express is the pits. The constant delays are depressing. The flight from Houston to Cincinnati was suppose to leave at 820 pm then 915 pm now 930 pm. There awaiting an aircraft. Coming to Houston from Cincinnati on 7/19/17 was the same thing. My flight got delayed three times while awaiting an aircraft. I am so annoyed and will never fly this airline again. I will definitely stick to another airline in the future.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | First and foremost this was my worst flying experience ever! We started are day by being at the airport at 7.30am. in Harrisburg, PA. We boarded plane (American Eagle) and were pulled out on tarmac and we had to stop due to no flights in or out of Philly. Weather cleared, we pulled out and the crew had to abandon flight due to mechanical issues. That brought us to our only option of flying United Airlines to IAD at 2.25 in the afternoon to get to a larger airport with more options. We had to wait for an incoming flight from IAD which was delayed due to a foul smell but we finally left after 4.00. Before leaving Harrisburg we had to change our connecting flight to MSP thinking there is no way we will make it. As it turned out we did make the flight, just barely. The plane was loaded and the door shut and we were ready to pull out. The entire flight had to get off and re check in because of a computer error. We were reloaded and then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours, flight crew not helpful, we were finally told we had to go back to gate for more gas which was a lie. In reality the flight crew timed out. No other crew available. The United help desk was so not helpful and horribly slow to re-book passengers. After nearly half an hour to 45 minutes we were able to finally get re-booked on flight to Chicago and then we would have to stay overnight and fly to MSP in the morning. At this point it was after 9 at night. We flew to Chicago (O'Hare) and luckily the flight scheduled for MSP was delayed two hours so we were able to make it home at 2.30 in the morning. I have to say the only good thing about the whole day was the flight crew on that last flight. Thanks to them my 13 year old son was able to make it to his soccer tournament.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Fort Wayne to Anchorage via Chicago. Worst experience I have had. Maintenance issue on the plane out of Fort Wayne to Chicago, they delayed it twice. The first time they delayed it, we were going to miss our connecting flight so we had to change our flight from Chicago to Anchorage. After getting off the phone the first time, I check my new itnerary and it didn't have my husband and I sitting together after I had told the lady we had a lap child. I called back to explain this again and she said for us to sit together I would have to pay to be upgraded. Meanwhile the flight out of FWA was delayed even further due to a part not coming in, and so I had to find an alternate route. She couldn't find me anything out of FWA that day, so we ended up having to drive to Chicago. Only then, when I told her we were driving did she upgrade our seats for us to sit together. On the way back, we cancelled the flight back from Chicago or Fort Wayne as our car was parked in Chicago. The desk in Anchorage said our last leg to FWA was never cancelled so our luggage was going to be sent there, I asked her to cancel our last leg and the lady at the desk told me I had to call to cancel it myself, and that they couldn't print off a baggage tag to have our luggage end up in Chicago. After being on the phone for 20 mins and the lady on the phone not understanding anything (as they never did every time I called, which was 5+ times) they were calling all United flights to Chicago to check in. So I finally gave up and had our luggage sent to Fort Wayne. I wouldn't recommend flying on this airline if you have a conncecting flight. I wouldn't recommned flying this airline if you have children. The fact that their plane was screwed up due to maintenance and the unhelpfulness of the staff to try and help us get to our destination was absolutely ridiculous. When she couldn't get us out of Fort Wayne on June 28th, the lady on the phone said she could reschedule us for July 30th! I had also gotten up to change my son's diaper in the lavatory. There was a drink cart blocking the lavatory in the front due to the pilots using the bathroom / getting coffee at the front lavatory and the pilot told me I had to use the back lavatory. So I walked back and the flight attendants were about 5 rows from the back with the drink cart, then the flight attendants said I had to wait until the pilots were done to use the front one. I asked if they could push the drink cart back for me to get through and I would wait to go to my seat until they were finished. She said I needed to wait to use the front one, I just couldn't wait up by cockpit. So I held my son for about 10 mins in the aisle before the pilots were done getting coffee to change my son's dirty diaper in the front lavatory.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to Frankfurt. Flight attendants were chatting loudly with each other during safety announcements. Flight attendants were obnoxiously loud throughout majority of red eye flight as passengers were trying to sleep. Our row was 2 or 3 away from the galley way yet the flight attendants were still very loud. They were unwelcoming and borderline rude during meal times. The light in the galley way was very bright and made it difficult to sleep (not sure if it was allowed to be turned off). Pilot/flying was great, but flight attendants made the experience overall unenjoyable.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Orlando. My flight was cancelled and they put me on a different flight and I was delayed and had to switch my flight again because I was going to miss my connecting flight. We asked to be put on another airline and the lady said we couldn't do that (which isn't true). She told us to go to the website and email or call them. We went on the website and there's no email. We called and there was over an hour wait. I will never be flying United Airlines again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines from Chicago to Charlotte. Flight delayed muliple times, first 45 minutes, than 1.5 hours then 3 hours, due to mechanical problem. This seems to happens regularly on their flights. I was apprehensive when booking my flight but thought that that I would give them another chance since American acquired them but it's the same old routine! I'll try not to fly them again!\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I have not travelled with United Airline for about a year. The policy has changed so much that it almost sounds like United doesn't want to retain cutomers anymore. On this flight from San Francisco to Phoenix, for basic economy passengers, not only they now want $25 for each carry-on they also force everyone to checkin the carry-on. This is a disgrace. First of all, the airline is greedy enough to charge carry-on fee. Secondly, they like to cause an incovenience to their passengers to have to wait for baggage claim after landing when it is carry-on and can be stored in the overhead bins. United Airlines is a prime example of corporations that wrongly put profit before customer experience. In my next time flying, I will surely stay away from United Airlines.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Liberia to Portland via Houston. I've flown with United Airlines many times, and this one was the last straw. They are typically unresponsive, slow, and rude. This time was no exception and it resulted in a delay.that delay turned into a longer delay due to weather which wasn't their fault, so I was understanding about that. However, after an hour and a half, the crew didn't want to wait any more and went home. At that point, my 9:17pm flight got bumped to 8:30 am. United offered no compensation with the exception of a 40% off coupon for some hotel I didnt want. They don't care about their customers. That's all there is to say. I'm never flying with them again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | 1.30pm flight to Houston originally, with a 9.30pm flight to Argentina.

We received updates by email that pushed the flight later and later, until 11.30pm, with 3 gate changes. Only received $75 off for another United flight as compensation, expiring in a year. While 9 members of our party are in Argentina, the rest of us have to wait until 9.30pm tomorrow to travel again. Most of us have been over 14 hours in the airport. We're just now finding arrangements for accommodations. Not a great experience.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Portland to Des Moines via Houston. I will never fly with United again.

When we were ready to board, they notified us that there was no more space in the overhead compartment so so we had to check our carry-on, which had fragile glass items inside. They labeled our checked bag with the wrong final destination, which was only corrected because we caught it. Staff were extremely rude and disorganized!', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Where do I begin, before booking this flight from Portland to San Francisco with United I looked through the baggage policy online to make sure I was able to take carry on and personal item. Website showed nothing saying I couldn't. Upon check in I was told that we were unable to take a carry on and would have to pay $25 dollars per bag to be checked. So there went $50 dollars. Let me add how rude every employee I met for them was! Absolutely no help or care in the world. Then we get to the gate and I see almost everyone bringing on both. With normal amount of overhead bins in the plane. So there is absolutely no reason for them not allowing carry on bags. I will never fly with them again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | We have been met with charge after charge flying with United. My husband and I originally booked our tickets to San Francisco and had to pay an additional $100 for the option to sit together and have a carry on! How does one go on vacation without clothes?! The trip fell through and we ended up changing to go to Cancun, Mexico instead. We were charged $400 plus about $50-100 in processing fees to change. Not only that, we were met with many additional costs that are new to us. I have flown many international flights and have always been given a meal. On this flight however, we were given a bag of pretzels and would be charged extra for snacks or a meal. I have also never been charged extra for a checked bag on an international flight. (We were actually allowed a carry on) Lastly, I have never been charged to watch tv. United offered no free entertainment and their directv option was $8. It was not a pleasant experience and I will absolutely be avoiding united in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | It is a comedy to fly United from San Francisco to London. 11 hours flight without a personal screen and TV.

At the gate I saw everyone coming off of my plane with backpacks and carry ons. I explained to the attendant, that I will be arriving in Detroit at 1am and I could not spare an hour or more to walk all the way to baggage claim to collect this carry on bag that I could easily take on the plane with me. It was your typical, the customer is nobody attitude. She could not care less about my opinion. Obviously United culture does not value the customer. I ended up wasting 1 hour and 45 minutes to collect my small carry on. Does anyone at United care that I got home at 3am? I don't think so.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Horrible. So many delays on this United flight from Minneapolis to Manchester, NH. After sitting all day in the airport, we finally start boarding and many of us are given tags for our bags to gate check them, saying they don't have enough room in the overhead compartments. There was plenty of room when I boarded the plane. I wanted to grab my bag so I didn't have to wait after landing for then to get it from under the plane. They wouldn't let me! It was sitting 4ft from the door! Needless to say it was a mad rush to the next flight. Not impressed.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | February 2017 UA1721 Moved to Hawaii, because of the time of year, locked in to using United Airlines PetSafe program. A fiasco. My recommendation is to fly a different time of year, use a different airline. United is more expensive than any other. We were told to be at the PetSafe cargo area 2 hours before flight, we arrived 3.5 hours early so we wouldn't miss the flight. The woman checking in pets was so slow that all of the pets ahead of us and ours got on the flights on time, we all got to the airport late. All missed our flights. A few minutes late to load luggage ruined the whole trip. Luggage has to be with passengers, pets do not? Put on another flight with 2 airlines, 2 airports, pets had to be boarded, needed a hotel, etc. until the next day. The price difference with the next booking was over $600.00 with no price adjustment. There is never enough help at the counters, people miss flights because of lack of employees. Pets are put in overnight boarding, an extra expense and extra stress on them. Money spent on hotel and food because you need to stay your first night on the island to pick up pets the next morning.

We called customer service to see if we could be compensated for this major inconvenience and they say \"well your still leaving tonight\". They offered no compensation at all. Now they claim we are leaving at 2:09am. This is ridiculous and unprofessional. I had a 4 hour delay with southwest before and they compensated everyone on the flight and we didn\\'t even have to ask them. They did it on their own accord.

We were told we would be able to make the 6:25 flight to Boston (granted we were supposed to land in Boston at 4pm) our flight was delayed 2 additional times, we finally left Newark, at 9:20 and landed in Boston around 10:15. We lost an entire day. No one would/could ever tell us what the delay was. We spent a total of 12hrs in 2 airports. I have flown on numerous occasions and I have had minor things happen but I have never had such a horrible experience with an airline. Not only was the flight experience bad, dealing with the rude airport staff was worse! Customer Service is obviously not part of their training for the job. We only had one lady go out of her way to help us, she was at the Knoxville airport, she was the only good experience we had with United! She did all she could to keep all 6 of my family members together. One lady I talked to had my 8yr old on a separate flight with her 15yr old brother. It was an absolute disaster. My family and I will never use this airline again.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | First time flying this route from Houston to Honolulu and I was not looking forward to it. Why? 8 hours in the sky with no free hot meals (you have to purchase from a menu and it's not cheap - $10 for a burger), no in-flight entertainment screens, and a sardine can economy cabin with the 3-4-3 seating arrangement. All this in mind and I was not eager to fly. As I boarded the plane and settled in my seat I noticed that yes the seats got narrower to accommodate more seats across but the seats are also new and well crafted with details. The seat was made out of this leather with detailed stitching patterns and a tag on the side that had the United logo on it and it had a cool color scheme to it too. Not only did it look good but it felt fairly comfortable for a small seat and the cushioning was decent. Legroom was also tolerable and take my word for it because I have very long legs. The seats didn't have those necessary in-flight entertainment screens but all seats were installed with a tablet/device holder so you can comfortably watch free entertainment on your personal device via the United wifi. (Make sure you have downloaded the United app before you board). The wifi connectivity was fairly strong though it didn't work the last half of the flight. Cabin crew were pleasant. They had poise, well groomed and very polite and I have no complaints or problems with them. The only huge disappointment I have is that for an 8-hour flight, no free meals were offered! It felt like a long-haul budget carrier flight! Of course, there was a full drink service. If you wanted to eat, you had to order from the menu a wide selection of hot meals that costed upwards $10. If it was that expensive then it should taste good I thought - which did. $10 Mediterranean chicken wrap was a rather small portion for a $10 meal but the tastes were worthy enough for you to think it came from Chipotle or something.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines from Denver to Los Angeles. Very dishonest business practices. I packed super light so I could fit everything in a small backpack since you have to pay extra to check a bag. Now you have to buy an upgraded seat to even use overhead space! I was forced to check my 7lb backpack for $50 round trip because it's too big to fit under the seat in front of me. Outrageous! I won't be flying with this airline again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Honolulu to Los Angeles via San Francisco. I just completed four flights with United Airlines within a weeks time and will not be using them again. The ground service attendants were downright rude in all three airports. All of the flights were overbooked and slow to board. On the three of the four flights all inflight entertainment and wifi was by purchase only. The LA to Honolulu flight we could use the screens on the seats for free with a variety of movies. The other flights had Direct TV screens which required credit card swipes. The 5.5 hour flight from Honolulu to San Francisco only offered one beverage service and no food cart. The flight attendants came through only to ask for garbage. Overall the airlines came across as a penny pinching organization that didn't care about customer service and lost sight of the cost involved for families to travel.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Check in was a challenge given the touch screens did not work properly. Staff were on hand but while friendly left before they could verify that the issue was solved. It was solved in the United Club. This meant that check in took much longer than it could have. Security cleared quickly, lounge was pleasant. My wife and I despite having the same booking number could not be seated together but this may have been due to changing our flight the week before. This also meant a downgrade to economy but on this short flight from San Francisco to San Diego doesn't make much difference as there is little on offer in either class. Flight left a little late but arrived on time. Plane was clean and comfortable and crew were very friendly. In all a pleasant experience, bags were available within 5 minutes of being at the carousel.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I am reviewing the Boeing 737-900 I flew from Chicago to Los Angeles with United. Basically a bad design (from the 1970s) with a new plastic facelift. No legroom for a 5ft 10in person - knees hit table metal, and no room for feet under Seat in front. Seat recline limited with entertainment screen in my face when person in front reclines. Use of laptop impossible! Now for my comments on the 1970 entertainment system, paid $8 and could not watch movies on demand - 5 hour flight, but always missed start of movies and tv shows - it's 2017. And then the controls for the entertainment system were located on the seat arm - needless to say that my neighbor got very upset several times after I changed her viewing channel Finally my expensive headphones could not save the poor quality 1970 audio jack plug and sound. Recommend going back to the drawing board!\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Detroit to Newark. My mom has been working for United for over 28 years so when I fly I use her buddy passes. Using her buddy passes this means that I fly standby (which means I only get a seat if one is available). I decided to fly home for the weekend so I decided to fly from Detroit airport to Newark on June 23rd. There were about 15-20 open seats on this flight so I knew there should be no problem getting on the flight. There were a few delays due to air traffic control and that is normal and expected on a busy day like Friday. After waiting a few hours in delays, it was finally time for my flight to board. I stood right by the podium as I waited for everyone to board and once they finished I went right up the front desk to ask if any stand bys have been called yet. The lady said she wasn\\'t sure and that she had to wait for one of the other agents to come back because she would have the answer. I waited about 5-10 minutes for the other agent to go back and I nervously kept looking at the screen to make sure that I didn\\'t miss my name being called but the screen still said \"Boarding\" and my name was not checked off the screen yet despite all of the empty seats. The United agent finally returned and when I asked her about the stand by\\'s she had nothing to say to me. All she said was that the doors were already closed and that I would not be making it on the flight. I did not understand what she was saying because there were no announcements made AT ALL about final boarding. Not only did the agent forget to call the whole stand by list, she never announced that boarding was coming to an end. Before the flight even began boarding, I specifically went up to the Agents and told them I was flying stand by and I asked them if they would be calling out my name so that I could receive my ticket. They assured me they would call me once everyone else was boarded. However, this was not the case at all. While this whole ordeal was happening, I was talking to my mom on the phone who told me that she never has seen something like this in her 28 years of flying. She was very upset by this as was I and instructed me to see if there was something else I could talk to. When I asked the lady if I could talk to someone else about this problem, she told me there was nobody else I could talk to about this issue. The lady then began to ignore me when I continued to talk to her about this problem. I was absolutely baffled on how an airline could just get away without giving a final boarding call for a flight. There was also another person on stand by who missed out on this flight because the agents never made the proper announcements. This was the last flight out for the day so it caused me to be stuck in Detroit for the night when this never should have happened considering there were over 15 seats open. Not only did the lady refuse to help or even tell me what happened, she failed to do one of her basic duties as an agent - which is make the proper announcements. I am a college student who cannot afford to pay to spend a night in a hotel so this left me in a terrible situation. I have flown United my whole life and I have never been so disappointed with them as I am today.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Houston. I\\'ve previously taken this route four years ago and I was expecting the same. Well, that wasn\\'t the case. For a trans-pacific flight, the flight crew was not approachable or polite in any matter besides maybe two who did an excellent job. There was one who was very sarcastic and rude to a passenger and another who was not knowledgeable of the food she was serving. The food portions were rather small compared to a domestic trans-con flight. For dinner, they served chicken rice or pasta with a roll and a cup of salad, and vanilla ice cream. In the middle of the flight, they served snacks. Ice-cold ham & cheese sandwich with Asian-style trail mix and a chocolate. The sandwich was terrible. I gave praise to the crew walking around the cabin giving away water in between meal times. Then before landing, breakfast. Cheese omelet with a \"rubber\" sausage and hashbrowns or this Japanese chicken rice with this bourbon cookie. The crew was not very presentable and mediocre, some of the crew looked like they just lazily put on their uniform without a care of how they looked. There were only two crew who had a smile on their face the whole flight. Some had the expression of regret for choosing their career as a flight attendant, some were just tired and wanted to go back to the crew rest, and some had great poise. The seat was rather decent for a 12-hour flight. Great legroom and recline degree and the cushioning are comfortable for sleep - there were even pillows and blankets. There was also an IFE screen on each seat but none of them worked the entire flight. The crew tried their best to reboot and get it to work but it wouldn\\'t budge. No movies or TV programs would work but games and the flight map did. It was a good thing there was in-flight wifi which you can connect to use the United app where you can enjoy free entertainment with latest movies and TV shows free of charge. Before I went on this flight I flew into Tokyo Narita from Manila and arrived at Tokyo on-time at 2:50 PM but this flight was due to depart at 4:30 PM. So once I arrived my boarding pass didn\\'t have info on the gate number but there was a United representative giving info specifically about that. Approachable and polite. The overall flight experience was decent - close to mediocre due to inconsistent cabin crew and meager cabin product compared to ANA who fly the same route on a higher level of service.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Dallas to Omaha via Chicago. My colleague and I were traveling for business this morning and had to be in Omaha by 10:30 AM. Our initial flight from DFW was delayed due to weather and that was going to cause us to miss our flight from Chicago to Omaha. We ended up cancelling the whole trip since we would not be able to make our meeting. I get it, no one can control the weather and flights had to be delayed, I\\'m not upset about that. What I am upset about is their solution to this series of unfortunate events. We were immediately shut down at the airport by the United concierge lady and she said that these reservations were non-refundable and there was nothing she could do. She suggested that we call the 1-800 number and they may be able to help us further. Once I got back into the office I called the United Airlines 1-800 number. Once I was connected to a live representative she said that she would be able to credit those trips back to both of us for future use with United ($128.80 each), but we would have to pay a \"flight change\" fee of $200 EACH. She basically told me that we would each have to give United Airlines $200 before we could use the $128.80 credit that each of us have. What I am taking away from this is that United Airlines does not care about it customers and the situations that they are put in. We had no intentions of cancelling these trips and only did so because we had no choice given the circumstances. They offered no help whatsoever and did not provide any sort of solution to the unfortunate situation that we were both in. My colleague and I wasted $257.00, and United Airlines said that we can still use that money with them if we give them an additional $400.00.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Trying for a routine trip from San Diego to Jacksonville via Chicago. Plane left late, so I missed my connection. Then new connection delayed over two hours, so I will get in after my rental car office is closed. Customer service was no help at all. Inflight WiFi kept stopping. I am a United Mileage Plus member, and it gets increasingly more difficult to earn upgrades and flights. Wife is a big Delta Airline fan and gets upgraded all the time. Flew Delta last month and was very happy. Time to switch from an airline that just doesn't try any more.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I booked a flight with United Airlines flying from PHL to JAX, with a connecting flight in Newark. First of all, I always fly American Airlines, but this time I decided to try out the cheaper option. This was a huge mistake. I signed up for flight updates twice, once when I bought the ticket, and once when I checked in for the flight ahead of time. I get to the airport and it turns out that they booked me on a train to Newark without making that clear. Luckily, I was early like I always am for my flights so I lugged my two suitcases to the train station to catch the train to Newark. After all this, I get to the counter in Newark and they tell me my flight was canceled. Mind you, I made sure my phone was on and charged all day to make sure I would be notified of any changes to the flight. The United employee told me the next flight out was for 7am the next day, but that they would not cover the cost of a hotel for the night, despite it being their error that put me in this position. I then ask if I can have them cover the cost for a train back to Philly, and they print the ticket out right there and hand it to me, and then they tell me if I want to get to Jacksonville (my original destination) that I would have to pay for a whole new ticket. When I make it clear that it's unacceptable for me to be forced to buy two full-priced tickets to the same destination, they tell me the ticket they handed me back to Philly was non-refundable. Then I ask if I can at least get on the 7am flight they mentioned before, but now they're telling me that it's completely booked, as well as the flight after that. The next flight I could be guaranteed a seat on is over a day from then, and again, they will not help with hotel costs. By now, I'm livid, and I talk to a supervisor and they take the ticket back, telling me they wouldn't be able to give me a refund on my ticket at all, despite it being their error that put got me stranded in Newark. After calling customer service I finally talk to someone who will give me a refund, but now I'm forced to buy a ticket for over a hundred more because it's last second, when I originally bought my ticket over a week ahead of time. They should have at least offered me the soonest flight from a competing airline, but they gave me nothing except a guarantee that I'll be paying hundreds more out of pocket for an absolutely terrible experience. I have been on several flights, both domestic and international, but United has by far been the worst experience I've had ever. Bad customer service, bad reliability, no notification system for flight changes, and little clarity in their system overall. I will gladly pay extra to fly with American Airlines (really any airline except United) from now on!\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew San Francisco to Maui. Never again. Haven't flown United for years and now I remember why. Had entertainment that we were required to pay for and very uncomfortable seating. Of course, we only had a cookie and one drink going to Maui. Return trip from Maui was over an hour late boarding, and we are sitting on the tarmac as I type because the gate is blocked with a broken plane. Going on 30 minutes so far. We had no entertainment since wifi was not operating and the free entertainment was thus not available. I won't even mention the stewardesses. Not into their job. JetBlue, Delta, Lufthansa (for Europe) here we come!\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Chicago O\\'Hare to Jacksonville, FL. Basic economy, what a scam. Means you have no options, no rights. You cannot select a seat, it will be assigned upon your arrival, good luck. You cannot check-in 24 hours in advance. You have to check-in at the airport and hope you get a seat. I booked a flight under Basic Economy fare for $585 (not cheap!) not fully understanding the restrictions. My bad, buyer beware. You will be the consumer that is \"bumped\" when they are over-sold, which is the case on every flight. I am a Premier member and a loyal United customer for over 25 years. The member who would always select United over American, Delta and other airlines. I called for help. Answer: Sorry nothing we can do, the system won\\'t allow us to override it. But, if you pay a $200 change fee plus additional $35 fare difference, we can cancel the Basic Economy and issue a non-refundable ticket. Now, no longer a United Loyal customer.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | As a long time Hawaii resident, I stopped flying them years ago for the same reason as everyone else. I decided to give it another try from Kona to Los Angeles and was really hoping for a good experience. It wasn't horrible but well below the standards of even Delta or Hawaiian.The aircraft is ancient and the only entertainment available is if you know in advance to download the United app. There is no advance notice of this, there is no WiFi at Kona airport anyway. If you haven't done this there is nothing. Unbelievably no one told the crew boarding had commenced and I walked into a dark cabin to find flight attendants sleeping in row 2. Embarrassing for all. Once they woke up the senior staff was actually fine with the minimum they are given to offer. Food was ok although oddly dessert consisted of a single piece of chocolate offered on the tray next to some crackers. No bread or salad was offered. This for a 5 hour flight in first class us a bit bizarre. The flight was on time, the crew was fairly pleasant, the seat minimally acceptable for 5 hours but really the experience was kind of bizarre due to all of the above.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Orlando to Washington.

Mediocre airline, seat is normal US \"first\" class. If we had breakfast, I don\\'t remember. Plane was clean, on time departure and arrived in Cancun.

I would fly United only if it is the cheapest.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | This is my first time using United Airlines and it is by far the worst. When I first arrived to print my tickets for Baltimore to Seattle via Chicago there was only one lady at the counter and about 7 customers waiting for her to take the bags, and it was slow. I didn't give it much thought, figured it was just one bad apple in the batch. Then I get 3 texts saying the flight was delayed a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes. Now I'm standing at customer service in the Chicago airport were they only have 2 people helping a huge snaked line. This airline is just a joke.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines hasn\\'t improved. This flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles ought to be the worst I have ever taken. Not because of the lenght, nor because of aircraft, simply because of the rudeness of most flight attendant on board. I think United should review their interpersonal skills with some of their staff. Only 3 staff were polite, the rest were just plain awful. Flight attendants going down the aisle pushing people without excusing themselves - really! I understand they have to work but could they have been polite. Working with public isnt easy, so if you cant do it: find another job. I had never flown United before and for sure now, never will. Next time I will go Air New Zealand again: \"They\" know how. You might as well be stuck somewhere than flying United. It avoids aggravation.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I've been flying United for years and this was one of their worst flights ever. They fly a massive Boeing 777 on this Honolulu to Houston route and every single seat was sold. The boarding process was disorganized and unpleasant. Due to slight turbulence, the frowning flight crew weren't allowed to serve drinks until 2 hours into the flight. Once they got moving, they were constantly hitting into people and waking them up all night. There were no free meals, no AVOD, no smiles, and the flight crew were absolutely unapproachable and miserable. It's a shame that Americans are willing to tolerate such a disgraceful level of service from this carrier.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United is the worst airline I've ever flown.

United's standard domestic first class is reasonably comfortable. The new Boeing 737-924s have United's latest amenities, including entertainment and flight information delivered to your pad, smart phone or computer via internal wi-fi. The selection of entertainment options is quite good and free. You must bring your own earbuds or headphones, even in first. Wi-fi otherwise is pretty dreadful and not worth whatever you pay for it. The inflight dynamic map is completely useless. First class service is quite good and attentive, but the food is mediocre. Gone are the days when the flight attendants constructed an ice cream sundae for each first class passenger, replaced by mango sorbet in a cup. Meal selection is handled rather oddly, with first choice going to those with the highest frequent flier tier status. Thus, even if you pay full price for your first class ticket, you may come up at the bottom of the pile in choosing your meal. Not endearing.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I am actually a fairly happy frequent flier of United Airlines, but you (and they) need to know what inconsistencies and problems flyers experience. Here are just some of the many independent situations I\\'ve experienced in 6 months (2017), all with United Airlines. 2 x jetway failures â€“ Upon arrival at gate, had to push plane out and had to wait on tarmac for another available gate. This made us 45 minutes and 35 minutes late these two examples. One of these examples, I missed my connecting flight. Had to sprint to connecting flight on the other. 2 x flight crew members didn\\'t show up for work - one 1.5 hour delay and one flight cancelled (after several hours) and had to stay overnight in Houston. Was forced to pay for most of hotel room. Luckily I was first in line to get rebooked the next morning and was also able to get an airport hotel room. Others were not so lucky 2 x sensor failures - On two separate trips had to return to gate after pushing off, one time there was no immediate gate and had to wait on tarmac for over an hour. Another time, plane was taken off service and we waited for several hours for a replacement. 2 x late planes â€“ Planes didnâ€™t arrive on time (not weather-related) and once we took off and landed at connecting airport, I had to run from terminal to terminal to make connection. Most other passengers doing the same connection did not make it. On the positive side, I will say that my status does help me solve many other problems that come up (some weather-related, some not), but for non-status passengers, those other situations would have been horrific. Also, Economy Plus is really the only reason I can enjoy my experience as much as I do.

(This is the same bag and belongings I flew with on the way here and it was totally fine). They bag was packed a little too big and I said all I had to do was move my belonging a bit around because I had just gotten something out of it and that's why it wasn't fitting correctly.

United Airlines is now joining the ranks of prestigious airlines like Spirit and Frontier where they nickel and dime you for everything.

This is why I avoid Frontier and Spirit and now I'll be avoiding United.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United's Basic Economy fare gives employees a mandate to treat customers with contempt and provide sub zero service. Unfortunately, United fare's from San Jose to Washington via Chicago was the cheapest. I work for the City of San Jose and have to book the lowest fare. I figured the fare was the lowest because of United's recent issues and as a result I would get at least okay service. This has not been the case. I've now learned that United has now created a new class called Basic Economy, which apparently does not work with self check-in. I did not realize that this fare meant, not only would I have to check my bag but would have to pay $25 or $50 if I took it to the gate. My seats get assigned at the gate by rude agents. As required by this fare I was the last to board and saw many open seats. I got all the way to the last window seat I was told with a huff that taking one of the many open seats farther forward would be a $119 upgrade.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Due to United Airlines incomparable incompetence my arrival was inexcusably delayed almost 12 hours. For a company who's customer service is already hanging by a very thin thread you would think that they would be doing everything to make your flights as smooth and pleasant as possible. And yet, on this day at the end of a very long journey, I find myself inflicted upon by their abysmal brand of service especially in regards to scheduling, and accountability. United Airlines first moved my first international flight up, only to delay it when I got to the gate back to its original time. I faced frustration and boredom being trapped in San Francisco airport facing not one, not two, but what became seven delays? Delays that have been caused by runway maintenance. A almost four hour delay that could have been easily avoided if you just had things together and scheduled your planes around the affected runways. Let's not forget the additional delay caused when the flight crew simply couldn't be found to come to the gate so we could start getting underway! After the above delays myself and my fellow passengers were finally able to board our flight - only to be told by the captain that there would be another brief delay while we waited for another crew member because one of the pilots was near the end of their union hours. We sit on the plane stuck for another 20 minuets or so, only to be told they can't find anyone, and can we please get off the plane because our whole flight is cancelled. A whole flight full of people kicked off of a plane, the majority of them with no other flights to their destinations. There were other flights, my bag for instance was on one of them. I know this because it's now 11.37 at night and the airport is very full, as were the lines to the customer service kiosks. Speaking of the customer service, the kiosk I get to is uncrowded but understaffed and run by clearly undertrained employees. The ones I'm dealing with keep having to ask each other for help, and give advice/plans that contradict one another. (All of this happens while the loudspeakers ask for a last call to a last flight to Dallas - the city I'm trying to get to) one of them even takes what seems to be a personal call while 'assisting' me (could have been work, but there was a lot of giggling). When I finally get hold of a supervisor I have to plead to get the next flight out of this godforsaken place, which I am reluctantly given as its with one of your competitors. Almost 12 hours later I do finally make it home - thanks to American Airlines. \", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Corpus Christi to Houston. United Airlines is the worst airline.

Supposed to leave at 11.30 am, delayed until 3 pm, delayed again until 4 pm. Who knows if I'll ever get home. So many people missed connecting flights. While sitting here waiting for the plane to be fixed, I hear agents announcing that this flight or that flight is overbooked! This seems to be the norm with United.

When I showed them the card which clearly says Star Alliance gold, they reluctantly gave me the priority tag on my bag. Upon arrival to Singapore, my bag is one of the last bags out (35 min wait) and does not have a tag. Furthermore the bag is all wet. The flight wasn't bad but the ground staff need major changes.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United is absolutely ridiculous. For the price you pay you get no guarantee you're going to get there on time. After delays then sitting on runways for upwards of an hour to incur further delays on the next flight in Jersey. You pay a ridiculous price for a service expecting to get where you request at the time you request it. Totalling upwards of 3 hours of delays, a food shortage on the plane, overhead bins clearly designated for passengers instead crammed with United employee paraphernalia, they've clearly taken away what precious seat space was left as you will be knees to the seat in front of you. Wifi isnt free as they advertise, no it is only free to view their partnering sales advertisements. Don't bother making plans for transportation upon arrival as you aren't promised you'll arrive on time. So much of our time wasted. Planned on using the metro train systems upon arrival but that can't happen as our flight will arrive hours after close of major public transportation. So we will incur further unexpected costs in transportation, to make up for the mess United Airlines has left it's passengers in, with No regard to the inconvenience or disregard for their customers time. I suggest Delta or Southwest to this airline any day. Never again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | On flight from Los Angeles to Washington Dulles the staff was extremely unpleasant. Not over concerned at that position not but then on arrival one piece of our luggage was lost. This was a direct flight and one piece missing? Came to find out that 10 people from our flight lost luggage. Several conflicting explanations were offered but after an hour we all left without our luggage. On our return flight was told after boarding that the only way to watch anything was by streaming thru our own devices and that we must download the United app. Of course that wasn't possible for the large number of attempts to access internet and App Store. Probably wouldn't complain but then we were delayed after we were seated. It was explained that they had no pilot or flight crew. Would drive to get us a flight crew and pilot ASAP. An hour after boarding we were told that the pilot Was at the airport and would begin preparing to leave. Still attempting to access App Store. I will never use United Airlines again!! By the time we back away from the gate we have already been seated for an hour and 20 + min. Most unprofessional travel experience.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Hamburg to Newark. We got a free upgrade to premium eco so me and my travel companion could sit together - which are standard seats with standard service and extra legroom - which was a decent move. Customer service is friendly and helpful, however the crew was a little rude. The Boeing 767 was old but not worn down, the IFE was aged as well. Cannot complain about the food (chicken or Pasta), but both flights were delayed at least one hour, HAM-EWR even 2,5 hours. Thus, United is a typical US carrier: nothing exciting, but solid.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United is garbage. They loaded the plane from Houston to Tampa and we sat there waiting for the pilots for over an hour at the gate. Terrible communication. No remorse, poor planning and management. Try to avoid flying them. Worse then the budget airlines in my opinion', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I am officially done with United Airlines and do not plan to use their service ever again. They are on the same poor quality list as Spirit Airlines now. Yesterday I checked in early for my flight from Newark to Raleigh/Durham via the United Airlines app and received a pop up message. The message stated one personal bag was allowed and a full size carry was not allowed. I was instructed to check in my full size carry on for the price of $25. When I attempted to bypass this message another message popped up stating if a full size carry on arrived at the gate I would be charged $25 to check the bag in and an additional $25 would also be added as a service fee for last minute baggage check. I went on the United's website where I saw carry on bags were allowed on the plane. Nevertheless I didn't want any problems so I checked in my carry on for a price of $25 when I arrived to the airport. At that point I asked a floor customer service representative about the notification I received regarding the full size carry on. I was informed that I was not allowed to bring a full size carry on because I purchased a ticket at a reduced rate on priceline.com. If I purchased my ticket through United at regular price I could bring my carry on onto the plane complementary. I could not believe it. To make matters worse when I arrived at the gate and they began to call passengers by group number, the representative clearly stated in her announcement passengers boarding with group numbers 1-4 may bring on a carry on luggage. I of course was in group 5, therefore I was disqualified. Although I saved money purchasing a ticket via priceline.com, in the end United made that money back by forcing me pay for my carry on bag. That is a clear Spirit Airlines move. You can get a cheap flight but you have to pay for other things. I see United still haven't learned how to treat their customers.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Have flown United Airlines from London Heathrow to Detroit via Chicago several times over the last few years. The aircraft are old and the minute you step in you get the feeling of arrogance from the crew, old women about to retire and clearly fed up. Not enough chicken meals for everybody, had to get a tasteless pasta meal. My connection to Detroit got delayed by 6 hours and got an apology email with a silly $50 discount on the next flight. No thanks. Worst airline ever. Avoid United Airlines at all cost. Just appalling.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to Cancun via Houston. Narita to Houston return I paid extra for a Economy premium seats. In flight service was extremely poor, flight attendants on both flights were unfriendly, spoke in rude tones. None of them ever smiled or expressed a word of greeting. Snacks were thrown on the lap of passenger who was next to me since he was sleeping. Quality of food was extremely poor, no presentation, servings were small. Bun/sandwich served for snack was dry and hardly edible. There was absolutely no value for additional money I paid for Economy premium seat. It was uncomfortable seat, with hardly any difference of leg space in the ordinary Economy class. There was nothing pleasant about the in flight service of 12- 13 hour flights both ways. I have over 30 years of flying experience with difference air lines, United Airlines was the worst in flight experience. I will never choose to fly UA again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to San Diego. Service was great, Flight Attendants were friendly. Food was offered on our flight, I got a chicken wrap and it was larger than I expected and tasty. The seats and leg room were larger than on most planes I\\'ve been on lately so for a almost 4 hours flight it was comfortable. My only complaint is when did it become ok to \"Dip\" tobacco and spit in a bottle ? The guys next to me enjoyed dipping the whole flight, getting fresh dip several times. The smell (minty like malox) gave me a headache but that fact he was allowed to spit in a bottle while I was eating was just gross. I don\\'t normally fly United and I have never had this happen before. Is this a normal allowed practice?', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Frankfurt to San Francisco. This is the return leg of a flight I booked with Lufthansa. The first flight was both Lufthansa planes. This return flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco is United Airlines. I know they are sister airlines but I swore last December I would never fly United Airlines again. United planes are old and very dated.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Los Angeles. United Airlines has the worst service. Having a trip with multiple intenarys I was told I needed to check my carrying on bag, normally I would not have an issue with this but seeing I had a flight to catch with a $1000 ticket this was not an option. The staff loading the flight were unwilling to cooperate and allow me to bring the carry on aboard or offer a solution to get my bag. They forced me to check my bag not giving me enough time to make my next flight. I will never fly them again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Kona to Portland via San Francisco. While checking in bags for a flight from KOA to PDX the credit machines /kiosks went down and though the ticket agent asked us to try several times (3 to be exact) we were not able to pay on the kiosk with a credit card. We waited patiently with the attendants and a growing line of passengers behind us for over a half hour. After the agent confirmed there was an issue with \"the lines for the machine\" and we were told \"it was being worked on\" the attendant said she would check our bags for FREE. She checked us in for our flight printed our bag tags and boarding passes and we went on our way, boarded, and flew home. Today there are three separate charges for $75 each on my bank card, for a transaction I was assured was free! Unacceptable. I was extremely patient and understand that tech issues happen but there is no excuse for poor customer service from the 800 number provided by the charging agent. When calling the phone number next to the 3 transactions on my bank account for customer service I was told that they can\\'t help me! Why have customer service agents that cannot fix problems. I am currently waiting on the phone and have been waiting for an hour and five minutes for a resolution to this problem and will certainly be filing a formal complaint. To top it all off, during my call with customer service the supervisor that I spoke with tried to blame the ticket agent! All of the agents at the airport, physically checking passengers in did a great job under the conditions. With every kiosk down they managed to help all of the passengers checking in for their flights while dealing with technical issues. I\\'m certain there are several other passengers that have experienced the same problem! I stood at the counter and waited while the gate agent called for assistance and was told it was a system wide problem or slow age. She did a fantastic job and provided excellent customer service and I wish I remembered her name so she could be recognized for been extremely helpful while trying to check in my family of five, included three children, for a flight home. We will not fly United ever again after this experience. The only reason I\\'m giving them any star for a rating at all is because the page forces me to.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | After all of the awful publicity that United received in the months leading up to our flights I was concerned that I had made a terrible choice for our journey from Sydney to Los Angeles. However, my 14 hour economy flight was probably about as enjoyable as any economy flight can be. United flies the lovely new 787 on this route, the air quality is better, the lighting is better and the seats, although they look really small, are actually amongst the most comfortable I have flown on. Video Entertainment is great, although the lack of audio was a bit frustrating, take your phone or Ipad along for this. Wi-Fi for purchase is a fun option to pass the time and costs are reasonable. The food was OK, a meal on departure, a snack in between and then a rubbery egg breakfast before landing in LA. The reality is this was an economy flight, the fare was really really good value. We resisted the constant sales push before the flight to purchase economy plus which does provide extra leg room if you feel you need it, at least with United have this option at a pretty reasonable rate if you feel you need it. By the way, this flight was spot on time as were all of our other United internal flights, boarding and disembarking was smooth as anything. The crew were friendly enough and seemed pretty happy about servicing our requirements, they appeared older than on most other airlines but were chatty and responsive.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | All United flights between Saipan and Guam are operated by Cape Air aircrafts.

My flight in SPS was cancelled to DFW, which meant I could not make my flight from LAX to SBA because I was not able to get from DFW to LAX. American was understanding and worked with me to get me to my destination multiple times while United told me to pay more than what the ticket was worth or to just basically let it go. The insurance is worth nothing from both United and the traveling company used as the travel company has the same plan as United. I used to fly United all the time, but now I will be avoiding them like the plague. Im very satisfied with American Airlines and highly displeased with United Airlines.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Chicago to Newark. If you're serious about getting to your destination unscathed, do not fly United. I recommend not taking United to all of my clients and vendors. United lost my luggage twice and every flight I have been on has been delayed. I simply can't trust United for my travel needs.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Most recently I was flying from Rome to Kansas City, via Turkish Airlines and United. Connecting through Chicago, my flights switched to United from Turkish Airlines. Turkish Airlines was able to ensure my bags made it from Rome to Istanbul to Chicago all in one piece despite multiple delays and a very long layover. United lost my bag in the 1 hours flight from Chicago to Kansas City. At the baggage claim the gentlemen said it was still in Chicago and would be delivered the next day. It was not. Unfortunately, they were still unable to recover my luggage as of 3 days after landing, forcing me essentially try to make excuses for not having the promised items at the meeting with my clients. I filed additional claims for my luggage twice, neither of which were even responded to. 4 days later, I called again, and was told my luggage was simply lost. I unchecked rechecked the bag in Chicago after arriving from an international flight, and they somehow lost the bag. Trying to get United to cover the costs of what was lost is proving to be even more nightmarish. The quality of service is astounding awful. I have had delayed bags before with United, but now having them simply lose my bag on such a short flight, and then fight me at every step when trying to claim the bag is shockingly despicable. If I would have known my Turkish Airlines flight was using United for the last leg, I would have never bought the ticket, as United is generally a terrible airline anyways for constant delays, uncomfortable seats, and delaying my baggage constantly. But this has trumped all other experiences regarding terrible care and costing me literal thousands of dollars for their negligence.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | This company doesn't deserve to be a Star Alliance member. I'm an elite member with Air Canada and United Airlines is far from being a good airline. First, no entertainment systÃ¨me and no power outlet in 2017 is unacceptable. Second, I had to change my flight and they switch my second flight with Air Canada to a United Airlines one without asking me. I had to make the change after I noticed it.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Lisbon to Newark. The new Polaris Business class of United is a very nice product. The seats are comfortable, the screen is a nice size and the new amenities kit is excellent. The seats are lie flat and offer a great rest. However, they are somewhat difficult to adjust at the intermediate levels, the upright and lie flat are done at the push of a button. Other than that, the only complaint I had was for the lack of storage on the seat - the old seats (and this may have been the ones in first) and small nooks to store stuff. That is not the case here, or at least I did not find them - so the storage has to be done in the overhead bins. Besides the very comfortable oversized pillow, United also provides you with two blankets, a regular one, and a slightly heavier quilted one. I initially used the quilted one, but since the temperature in the cabin was quite comfortable I eventually gave up on both. The food is a little lacking, for the first course, I chose the Halibut which was very good but second meal was a very dry and flavorless piece of chicken breast. This, in my opinion, is a problem, primarily because it is served an hour before landing and sticks in people's memories as their meal experience. The service while professional is not on par with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. While I cannot put my finger on it simply lacks the elegance and savoir-faire of their counterparts. Another big issue is the entertainment, while there is an excellent selection I cannot for the life of me understand why I constantly have to be subjected to Barracuda and Marriott advertising - it is not just once, but after every single show that I want to watch. This really cheapens the United brand, if you want to do it on the domestic legs to offset the entertainment costs the so be it - but to do it on the international leg in business class is unheard of. United is definitely on to something with Polaris, with a little fine tuning this could become a Business Class for others to follow.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I was forced to check my carry on because the flight was full. I told them I didn\\'t want my bag checked but they told me I didn\\'t have the option to bring it on board with me. They managed to lose my bag. When I filed the report at the airport they tried to put the blame on me, like I wanted me bag checked. Then they proceeded to tell me my bag had been located and it would be delivered early the next morning. The next morning came and went, no bag. I called to see what happened only to be told, \"we have located your bag and we will put it on the first available flight out and have it delivered to you asap.\" I was, confused and irritated. I explained that my bag was located the night before and should of already been delivered to me. They then told me I could go ahead and spend $150 to replace the items in my bag while they got this sorted out. I thought, well at least they are trying to do right by me. This game went on for 4 days! My bag was finally delivered after I returned home from my vacation and after several angry phone calls. They kept getting my delivery address wrong, my bag color wrong and managed to ship my bag to several different airports before it finally made its way home. Once my bag arrived, I called United to get the $150 refund that they promised me plus some compensation given all the hassle. They actually told me, \"sorry, looks like whoever told you that failed to make a note in the system so we cannot offer you a refund now.\" \"The best we can do is $125 travel voucher for your trouble.\" As if I\\'d want to fly with that useless airline again.

When standing in the customer service line in F terminal we were all told that there was another customer service center in B terminal if we wanted to go over there. Everyone stayed in the line waiting patiently to get helped. There were approximately 5 or 6 people in front of me. The supervisor was standing behind the counter and says they are going to be going down to one agent shortly and we could go to B terminal if we wanted. We all decided to wait where we were since we did not know how long the line was in B terminal. Then all of the sudden he says that this counter in F terminal was closed. He never pulled the strap and closed the line. We all said to him that he had told us they were going to one agent and we were all willing to wait. Why are you now changing and closing the counter wile there are people waiting to get helped. He made his staff leave immediately. I walked to B terminal next to him and asked him for his name. He said I'm not giving you my name. He told me that he had worked 18 hours and can't work anymore or he gets penalized. When we all arrive at the customer service counter at B terminal it was exactly what we were all trying to avoid when in B terminal, Long lines! He then proceeded to go behind the counter in B terminal and continue to work along with one of the customer service ladies that was at F terminal. He had told me when walking to B terminal that the staff that had been at F terminal had would too many hours and could not work more. That was clearly not the case since they started helping people in the line at B terminal. We could have all been helped where we were and much faster than having to get in a longer line. His attitude and actions are completely unacceptable!

As if it couldn't get worse they announce that only one air conditioner was working so it's going to be stuffy. I will never fly United again.

I\\'ve never had this issue on any other airline, even on newer planes of similar models. I\\'m not sure if this is a manufacturing defect, or they purposely made the rows so close together that I had to have my knees jammed into the seat in front of me (more so than usual), or the seats so tiny I could barely move or even buckle my seat belt. I am not an overweight person, I\\'ve never been this confined on a flight in my life, and I travel pretty frequently.

United was seriously testing our skiing endurance. After sitting at the Albany gate for 20 minutes, the pilot informed us that the grounds crew forgot to load our bags! Itâ€™s not like we were the first flight. There was a United flight leaving at the gate over 30 minutes before us. My fiancÃ© and I ended up running to our next gate because what was a 40-minute layover turned into a 15-minute layover in a different terminal. After sprinting up and down to the gate at Chicago, we arrived in the knick-of-time. We were able to grab salads at a stand outside the gate. After boarding the plane, we decided to eat our salads. Oddly we are able to finish our entire salad without moving. After sitting for 30 minutes, the pilot informed us there is an abnormal number of children on the plane therefore we were waiting for children life jackets. An hour goes by and we are informed from the pilotâ€™s calculations we will need additional fuel, so we waited on the fuel truck. At this point all the young children who needed life jackets, are highly uncomfortable because the plane is becoming warm - over 80 degrees. It was an older plane so they could not turn on the AC. Think about all the poor parents! Scheduling is important to everyoneâ€™s well-being and we are now an hour and half late. If you can believe it, we were then informed the fuel truck put too much fuel in the plane! We are now waiting for another truck to take out some of the fuel. After sitting at the gate for an hour and 45 minutes, we were informed we will be leaving as soon as the second truck comes by because the first one broke down! We only sat at the gate on a stifling hot plane for two hours on what is normally a two and half hour plane ride. The 100-meter dash to the finish line was that half of all passengers bags on the plane did not make it to Steamboat ours included! We were in great shape to go skiing!', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Norfolk to Honolulu via Newark. Terrible experience! I haven\\'t flown United in years and I wish I had kept it that way. They booked my flight with a layover in Newark, I had a carry on that they said needed to be put under the plane due to no room in the overhead bins, the agent put a green tag on my luggage, when we landed and I tried to get my luggage the agent asked me for my \"green ticket\", I then told him I did not receive a ticket and everyone else on line said they hadn\\'t gotten one either, he said \"well then you\\'ll have to go to the carousel to pick up your carry on\", thank god another agent basically said to ignore him. After we got the luggage we had to take a bus to the terminal, when I got to the terminal I knew we were cutting it close so myself and 2 other passengers ran to the gate where we were supposed to catch our flight to Honolulu. We ran up to the terminal and the agent said ( with great satisfaction) that we were too late, even though it was 10 minutes before our flight was supposed to leave. Why United scheduled our flights with no time to get to our connecting flights does not make any sense. Our flight was on time to our connecting flight but we had to take a shuttle and the gates were pretty far apart, we landed at 7:10 and our connecting flight boarded at 7:10! There was no possible way to make that flight. They put me on another flight but tried to give me economy class instead of the first class I paid for. I called the 800 number and they were absolutely no help, the agents in the airport rescheduled me on a different first class flight. The flight to LA the plane was nice, the food was great and the stewardess was awesome but from LA to Hawaii the first class plane was lousy, no tv\\'s in the headrests and not much more leg room then economy class.

I wanted to take my whole family (parents, my sister, her husband, and my three children) on a great trip. I am a single mom and this trip was a long time coming. It took me a long time to save up to pay for this flight (for all 8 of us) and to pay for a place for us to stay. We get on the plane to Newark from Pittsburgh and we had to wait 30 mins because they didn't fuel the plane. Now maybe it's my ignorance but shouldn't that be done before the passengers get on the plane? Why have people waiting after all the crazy things you have to do to get through security check with 8 people. While we were on that plane they delayed our flight to San Juan from Newark four hrs. Now if I was by myself I wouldn't be complaining but with a family of 8 this was no walk in the park. But once again maybe it's my ignorance but the flight was delayed because they didn't have a working plane. This to me is just unacceptable. This is all without any other compensation other than meal vouchers. Partly my fault because I was to naive to think I needed insurance for such a trip. Silly me! After five hrs of idle sitting my children couldn't careless about eating. But that's not the end of this great vacation that turned into a complete nightmare. Our flight was delayed yet again.

Our itinerary was cancelled without any notification for missing a flight in the itinerary. This resulted in a chaos for our travel plans and we had to spend over 2 hours on the phone with customer services. After speaking to various supervisors our flight was reinstated, but all our meal selections and seat selections disappeared. Our family had to sit in different spots and with my daughter who turned 13 mid-flight could not be seated with her whole family together. Our food selection was also not available and as a result our family had to survive without much food. What a pretty special way to celebrate a 13th birthday. As a dad I was quite ashamed to fly my family on United Airlines! Also United planes do not have privacy filters on the TV screens and all the screens are visible from everywhere. With the person sitting next to our daughter watching \"R\" rated content it was also very disturbing. All they need on your screens is a filter and only the person sitting on front of it can see the information on their display while people on either side only see a darkened screen.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I am a frequent flyer in United Airlines travelling about twice a month. It's extremely disappointing that I have been forced to check my bag time and again in while boarding, even when there is space in yet cabin. It is ridiculous! How can the cabin crew not communicate accurately to the people at the gate? I travel on business and so that I can move fast I travel light carrying only a cabin bag so I can zip to my destination as soon as I deboard as opposed to waiting at the carousel. This defeats the purpose. It's absolutely frustrating. And on top of that the lady at the gate was not courteous either: United certainly seems to be excelling at their growing reputation of pathetic customer service and it keeps getting worse. I wish I had more options to switch flights, I would want to avoid United. I have been patient but to go through this time and again is awful.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to Houston. This airline has continually declined. I used to only fly United because the service was great. On the flight over my mom and I were separated despite booking over 5 months in advance. The gate attendees in Houston were so rude.

My mother died in January and I had the rudest service when I tried to make an emergency trip to go to the funeral. It cost me a fortune. I was bumped to the cheapest flight, foreign airlines, worst seat. They lost my baggage, could not upgrade. No understanding at all, everybody was so rude. It is impossible to fly with United, fee for everything, penalty for any change completely disgusting. The only reason we keep flying with them is because they have a monopoly on the Houston market.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | New York LaGuardia to Denver. Another poor experience with United. Shabby plane with very uncomfortable seats, tortoise like speed of service (why can Southwest serve drinks twice as fast?) and then the inevitable delays. Having been on 3 or 4 domestic flights this trip it seems at least part of United's problem is the endemic lack of capacity at key US airports like LGA. Every time delays taking off, delays finding a gate on arrival. All very frustrating. I thought the UK was bad at infrastructure with LHR running at 99.9% capacity but at least there are only delays there when there's a specific problem. At US airports it seems routine. All pretty unbelievable really - I ended up pining for the ruthless efficiency of easyJet and Ryanair back home which I never thought possible.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Costa Rica to Boston via Houston with United. First my flight from Costa Rica to Houston is delayed 2 hours and 50 mins. Then slowly turns into a 7 hours delay. My connecting flight in Houston departs at 3:52. After telling the flight attendant I have a flight right after we board and begging to be let off early he tells me I'm not the only one. Then after my flights gets into Houston at 3 and I run through the entire airport, which is not small, and took a train. Go through customs, immigration, re-checking bags and all that. I finally see the gate at 3:42 and me and 2 other women watch them close the gate and tell us they gave our seats away. Even though we have 10 mins till departure. Staff at the gate wouldn't speak to us. The next flight is 5 hours later. No mention of anything being their fault. I will absolutely never travel United Airlines again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I have just had a very frustrating experience with United Airlines. I bought two tickets for NY, mine with $, my wife's with miles + dollars both using my United branded VISA card. I called and asked the record to be combined so that she would also get her first bag free and was told by the agent that this was accomplished. However, when I went to check-in tonight I discovered that this was not done. After an hour on hold, I spoke to a supervisor who told me that this couldn't be accomplished and that my wife would have to pay a fee for her first bag! The supervisor told me there was no way she could waive this fee. This seems like a bait and switch operation for both United and Chase VISA. A poor way to treat a frequent flyer and high dollar user of the United branded VISA card. One more example of why many people, now including me will try to avoid United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | This United flight was the return part of a same-day trip Washington to Tampa return. Both flights were boarded with good discipline, pushed-back early, and arrived ahead of schedule. The service in economy was minimal, but there was a normal beverage offering: soft drinks for free and alcoholic beverages for a reasonable charge. I reserved and received the exit row window seat, which is my favorite. The personal device service onboard is a step forward, but the flight map included is much inferior to the one Lufthansa offers. As a Star Alliance Gold, I took the hike over to the B concourse to enjoy the Lufthansa Senator Lounge, which was surprisingly uncrowded. These last few weeks have been a trial-by-fire for United Airlines. Many frequent flyers have been outraged by egregious onboard errors, but my experiences with United have always been positive. I have several trips with them planned for next month, and I hope and expect that these flights will go smoothly as well.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I fly to Ireland twice a year now and use either United or American. This is the first time I flew in a 767. I was most interested in the new United Polaris Business class. It may be different on the larger planes, however, on this aircraft the cabin was no different and was not new. The food from the new \"chef\" was the worst I\\'ve ever had in business class on any airline out of the 4 or 5 airlines I\\'ve traveled on in Business class. Having read the glorious PR about their new \"chef,\" I was really looking forward to the food. I wouldn\\'t serve it in Economy and they ran out of the Chicken dish by the time they got to me. The fish (my reluctant second choice) was over cooked and dry. The green noodles were stuck together on the bottom where I assume they were overheated. On the flight from Palm Springs to Chicago, I was trapped in Economy since there was no business class on that plane. I sat in the 3rd row and the attendant announced they were out of the cheese plate and cheese burger to the row in front of me. I flew two days after the huge PR disaster, dragging a customer off the plane kicking and screaming. It seems that is not the only problem. This airline is not run well. When the poor attendant in Business class announced to me they were out of the chicken dish I ordered, I was a bit upset and she apologized and said it had been a rough couple of days. My other complaint is an ongoing problem that everyone I know is dealing with. They keep advertising their frequent flyer program but when you actually try to get a business class seat, it is impossible most of the time. As an exercise recently, I tried to get a seat for the rest of the year--8 months!--and there were two flights in those 8 months that I could get a business class seat flying from Palm Springs to Cork, Ireland, and of course that only applies to the long flight, not the two short flights on either end which must be economy. I tried last August to book Business class seats both ways on this current trip and there were no seats available on the return flight--though online it shows 27 available seats in Business class. I\\'ll be using American from now on.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Amsterdam with United. Flight attendants were in a rush to serve dinner on this 8 hour flight. No smiles - just get it served and get it picked up. Since I spent 250,000 if my hard earned points to fly business on my first trip to Europe since 1986 I was anticipating a bit of a happier mood throughout the business cabin. Also, this was the vaunted new Polaris class which in my opinion was far from great. At 6\\'4\" I should have been able to stretch out flat, but because of the shape of the pods that could not happen. The seat was also very uncomfortable. This was some of the worst food I have ever been served on United. Thank goodness our flight back was on Air Canada which was a wonderful experience. Rest assured my new travel card will be Bank of America and where I not only earn more millage than with my current Chase card but also will not be stuck flying United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | These 757-300s are over 15 years old and should not still be flying. If you are sitting in the back, expect it to take at least 15-20 minutes to deplane. The outbound (BOS-ORD) plane, N57870, had no TVs. It was just overall a dirty and run-down plane. The return (ORD-BOS) plane, N75858, did have TVs. When I\\'m on a plane that has TVs, I usually watch a movie on my iPad and turn the TV to the map channel. It took almost 20 minutes for me to find the map, then while we were something like 15th in line for takeoff (because that\\'s just how things happen at O\\'Hare), the screen told me that my \"free preview\" of DirecTV was up and I had to pay to continue using the TV for anything, including the map. Shortly after takeoff, I opened the movie on my iPad and saw that I had forgotten to rent the movie I wanted to watch (and I admit that this was on me). I decided to watch a movie on the seatback TV and just pay the fee. However, they didn\\'t seem to want my money even when I was desperately throwing it at them. The credit card reader didn\\'t work no matter how many different ways I swiped my card. Eventually, I paid for an hour of free internet on my phone and transferred it to my iPad. The flight was halfway through at this point. I fly this route (BOS-ORD and back) several times a year to visit family. American Airlines is absolutely awful, and the most ironic thing is that we booked with United out of spite for American. Both American and United are horrible, so no matter how early in the morning their flights to Chicago are, JetBlue, here I come!', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | This was my first time traveling with United Airlines, however it was frustrating. I was travelling with my family from Los Angeles to Maui which was a 6 hour flight. The services from the check point to the flight attendant was very bad. There was not a friendly person in the flight crew. We had booked the ticket 10 months ago and had payed high price for it, but still got the worst seat when flighing to and fro. One time we were assigned the last row seat next to the toilet and when came back they give the seat next to exit by the wing. Both the seats could not be adjusted. I don't understand how they assign seat? I had self checked 24 hours go, but I still got the worst seat. After paying a high price ticket they wanted an other 75$ if I wanted a better seat. I have travelled in several airlines but United airlines is the worst. I won't recommend this flight to anyone.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Returning home from a family trip to Santiago (Dominican Republic) to Newark, I became very angry because having chosen our 4 seats together at time of purchase like I always have, we were separated by 23 rows. Having a 2 year old daughter and a 6 year old son this is sad. On top of that sitting on the last row with my daughter, I sent my wife and son on row 15 two lunches with the flight attendant, which never got to them. Food was given to someone else. Got out of the plane after landing to find out that they had no food the whole flight. I don't think we will choose United Airlines in the future.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | It started not too bad with the lady at the check-in being friendlier than expected despite the check-in facilities being rather uninviting. Next was the surprise that there\\'s no lounge access for First Class passengers unless you\\'re a frequent traveler. Yes, first world problem but with service-oriented airlines that\\'d be a \"no go\". Everything from boarding to disembarking goes by \"not yelling is already friendly enough\". Old 757 aircraft (not unexpected with United). Inflight entertainment screens the size of my phone and no on demand program. The real disaster though was the general condition of the aircraft. It was filthy. My personal highlight was the tray table. This one has not been cleaned in a long time. Although the flight wasn\\'t bumpy, the coffee came in a mug that was clearly spilled over, but hey, who cares. Seated in row 1 as well gave me the pleasure of a free foot bath as obviously either the galley or the bathroom on the other side of the wall had a leak. Luckily it was only water soaking the carpet, my bag and my shoes. Here as well just shrugging shoulders when I asked for help. I really travel a lot around the world but there\\'s no other airline that every time manages to underwhelm. United is a disgrace for Star Alliance who normally offers a premium product (LH, TG, LX, SQ, OZ and so on). After several disappointments and the latest incidents neither me nor anyone of my colleagues will consider United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew from Warsaw to Frankfurt with LOT Polish Airlines and then to San Diego with United, with a transfer in O'Hare. Generally not a very pleasant experience. The aircraft was old and you could feel it - seats were almost broken, my screen of the entertainment system was broken as well (it recognised touch on the right part of the screen but not on the left part). Also the headphones were broken. Cabin crew was very welcoming and friendly, on the other hand. As for food, it was not so great but I've eaten worse. We started-off late from Frankfurt and I was a little worried because my transfer in Chicago was tight so it was a huge relief when the captain informed us we landed on time in O'Hare. Too early! It turned out the airport didn't have a gate ready for us and we were standing 45 minutes on landing field. Then my transfer become really tight and I literally had to run through the entire O'Hare. Fortunately, the aircraft to San Diego was waiting for me as they knew flight from Frankfurt had issues with the gate. My baggage didn't make it on time to the San Diego flight but United sent it over to my hotel a day later. Overall, compared to Lufthansa with which I was returning, United was an average experience at best. It definitely isn't the worst airline in the world.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to London. My first impression when checking in the staff seemed friendly but pushed for time meaning the service was quickly over, although it was fast it came across rude when they would hurry me and my travelling friends along. When boarding the aircraft we were welcomed by a lovely set of crew that were happy to point us in the direction of our seats, I was confused as to why there were not any other crew members in the centre of the aircraft welcoming us, like on other airlines I have flown with, all the flight attendants seemed to be in the back galley chatting amongst each other. After takeoff the flight attendants started the service offering drinks, smiling didn't seem like an option for many of the crew I was confused as I noticed across the middle seating that the other crew members were bright and cheerful. The inflight meal was rather poor, I had two options one that I was told was pasta and the other chicken, that's about as much information that I was given so I chose the chicken - it was hardly chicken when there was about four smaller pieces of chicken inside and some bread and a side dish the cheese sauce was vile as it was getting cold by the time the cart had reached me. During the flight two medical emergencies came up with the group I was traveling with, the flight attendants were quick to react and made sure that both passengers where okay. They asked for any medical professionals to step forward and the matter was resolved within around an hour after departure when a travelling nurse was able to help. I think the inflight entertainment system was really great to occupy those who couldn't sleep. Before landing the flight attendants brought out breakfast, this was disappointing because there was so little.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines from Houston to Los Angeles. The United customer service has proven to be unfriendly. I have received better support from ex continental employees than those of United and they are getting harder to locate as the new hires take on the persona of the sardine flight company that overlooks all of its flights. In calling to try and find a set of seats that we could sit together the only seats that they could find were at row 37 where we were split between row 8 and 25 previously. They also then wanted over 100 dollars to upgrade one seat where I was offered nothing for moving backwards in seating. They also offer no support for the consumer nor do they recognize those that have traveled most of their adult life, if it were not for all of the continental lifetime miles I would chose an alternative airline company to fly and if Alaska Airlines had a better connection out of Houston it would probably be the best of those I have flown recently.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Due to fly from Newark to Las Vegas. I have never been on a United flight that departed or arrived on time. The majority of United Airlines employees are rude and act as though we the customers should be grateful that we are allowed to be in their presence. Bags have been sent to different states, or sent to different baggage claim #, without telling us, then when we inquire, the answer is never polite or helpful. It is always rude and abrupt, like we are interrupting their day. The last time, my husband\\'s bag was supposed to be at a certain carousel, he waited for over 45 minutes while an employee \"looked for it\", then a completely different employee brought it to him and said it was on a different carousel, #9 in fact, and \"didn\\'t everyone know that carousal #9 is where to look for missing bags?\" There was even a woman behind him, with an infant in her arms, whose bag was sent to a different state altogether and was told she could either wait a few hours in the airport (the infant presumably) or it would be delivered to her the next day, but that she would have to be there at her home to sign for it. When she asked what time would it be delivered, they honestly said \"sometime.\" Seriously. The woman explained that she needed a more concrete timeframe, so the employee replied with \"sometime before 5 or 6 pm.\" I am now sitting in the airport, waiting on yet another delayed United flight, one that says the plane has been here since 5 am, and so we should be on-time, as our flight is scheduled to leave just before 10.30. Unfortunately, and rather not surprisingly, that plane is now being \"changed\" and my flight is \"at least 45 minutes delayed.\" United is hands down the worst airline, with the worst customer service - you can\\'t even call someone - and certainly not worth the price. I will be paying extra in the future to just to avoid flying United.

Ten minutes before flight boarded I was notified that there was a broken seat 4B in business class and one person in my party needed to be bumped to coach. This seat was broken prior to leaving Newark to SJD. I should have been notified prior to going to the airport so I could have found alternative flights in business class. I should have even been told when I checked in at the airport. There should be better communications with passenger if they are going to get bumped and not tell them 10 minutes before boarding. Furthermore I thought it was proper for an airline to ask for volunteers for compensation and not just be bumped which never occurred. United Airlines customer service is horrible and have zero care or concerns for passengers and I fly every other week, always in business or first class. I will only fly Delta and American Airlines in the future. United Airlines repeated complete disregard for passengers is clearly apparent and I will never put myself in this situation again.

We were on a 6 hour international flight (to West Coast Mexico) and they didn't even offer a free meal. Only overpriced sandwiches to buy. And on our way back the only thing they offered for purchase was Pringles and some other chips. Unbelievable! Very uncomfortable, very little leg room, no screens on the back of the seat in front of you. They suggested that we download their app to have some entertainment on our own electronic devices, but didn't offer headphones! I felt like they were mocking us. The pilot told us there's free WiFi on board, but it wasn't there! No pillows, no blankets. Extremely slow service. We were in the back of the plane, they had only one group of flight attendants serving everyone, so we had to wait for two hours to get something to drink. Very unpleasant experience\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Hartford to Pittsburgh. The absolute worst airline you can possibly try and take. Drove to the airport at 5 am just to tell me that the $600 seats I purchased were OS. They literally waited until I was boarding to inform me of this! How does that make any sense at all. If you don't have the tickets don't sell them. To top it off they tell me they're not sure if they will be able to refund them. 5 days later after I called highly upset they magically get refunded back to me. A week later I'm in a pinch and give them a chance to redeem themselves. Flight gets delayed which is fine but they told everyone it would be delayed 25 minutes. The flight left 1.5 hours later. Nobody on the flight could make their connecting flights and they offered nothing for us! The staff didn't even care that people were upset and now most likely had to sleep in DC they just continued to take their good Ole time with everything. Can't wait to land and see kind of BS they offer me for causing me to now miss work and my family tomorrow.

I will never fly this airline again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Zurich in Premium Economy, Seat 28B, an exit row. I am not sure the extra price of more than USD219 is really justified. Okay, you have plenty of legroom but you should be aware that the proximity of the Economy cabin lavatories means that you will have people tumbling over your legs the whole night. Apart from that the seat is lacking any cushioning (maybe because it is so worn after 16 years of service) so it becomes a pain after a while. And then you need to accept that all that premium eco thing does not buy you any better food service that is - compared with other airlines - simply really poor. Not that it tastes bad but the amount of food you receive is simply poor. Imagine getting a croissant in the morning coming along with a micro-sized jam pack but no butter.

Beijing to San Francisco leg was delayed departing, and arrived at SFO gate with 50 mins before scheduled SFO-BOS leg. I made it to gate but was informed that my itinerary [in First] had been switched, to a coach seat 4hrs later. At this point, UA were still offering first class seats for sale [including mine] on both the original SFO-BOS leg and also the later SFO-BOS flight.  This generated some amusement from the UA baggage handlers and gate staff which was at best disrespectful. After 30 days back and forth they refunded the class difference sum [$220 from a total of >$3400] but refused to refund change fees or offer explanation regarding selling on available seats [including mine] or offering a First class seat option [which I had paid for]. As a result, this was my last ever UA flight. I have flown BOS-PEK and BOS-LHR eight times since this incident with other carriers and have been rewarded with premium level service in the air and on the ground.

Again, when it was almost 12:xx, they delay it to 1:xx. Several times! The most annoying thing is that they didn't even know when it could fly, and they came to ask your decision, if you wanted to fly today, or tomorrow! OK, if it was myself, I could handle it. But the traveller was a 72-year-old, non-English speaker. Because of this delay, she missed her second flight from SFO to Shanghai. She definitely needed assistance in SFO, either logde into an hotel or some place for rest. When I call United's customer service (headquarter), they couldn't connect me to their branch in SFO. My mother-in-law had to find the United counter by herself. When I asked what to do with her checked-in luggages. They said my mother-in-law needed to picked it up from carousel and re-check it!

There was no way I could be put onto the upgrade wait list, although I had an up-gradable Economy ticket (B-Ticket). It seems United only allows their own MileagePlus holders to be put on wait list. For me this was very frustrating, as there were a couple of people who were upgraded to Business on the subjected flight.

Unfortunately, they forgot to tell that you needed to download a plug in prior to board so the option was useless. You had an additional option: purchasing wifi to download it. I did it, but the plug in never worked and no-one seemed to know how to fix it, of course. So I spent my flight watching FB (of course, when you leave China). The flight was packed with Chinese families that don't seem eager to educate their children to live with other people. I had to ask for help because a child was yelling and playing with his father endlessly.

I was given access to the United First Class lounge which was located closer to the boarding area of the flight. The Business Class section was 2x2x2 seating, causing window passengers to cross over their seat mates. The service was excellent and the food and wines were good, however, I did not get my first choice, fish. So much for ordering the white wine and ending up with beef. My main complaint was that the fasten seatbelt sign came on at least 12 times during the flight and it was a smooth flight. Several times one little bump would cause the fasten seatbelt sign to appear, which would trigger the recorded announcement, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. For your safety and for those around you, please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt.\" A flight attendant would then do the message in Chinese. The television monitors (many which were turned off) would all turn back on and with a bright white background with the message a special announcement is in progress. This certainly lit up the entire cabin. I would strongly recommend that if you fly on United\\'s 787 aircraft, you bring good earplugs and eye shades. In short, United is not a good airline if you want to sleep on the flight. This was a smooth flight and the flight attendants were never asked to sit down but I was woke up many times during the flight. Singapore Airlines does this same flight using an A350, which offers more room in economy and 1x2x1 seating in Business Class.', 'united airlines â\\x9d\\x8e Unverified | Punta Cana to Newark. Worst airline ever! They canceled our 3rd March flight at 10:00pm due to not having a pilot (due to reaching their max hours for the day) after we were already boarded. The flight was already delayed to top it off. The reps at the airport were rude and refused to help. I called the United customer service number and they hung up on me. Finally after getting someone on the line supposedly the only flight they had was for us to leave at 3 in the afternoon on 4 March with getting us to Des Moines after 9 PM! As one gentleman (who was on a different flight but his flight got canceled for the same reason) put it \"They had all damn day to crunch the damn numbers\" and at 10 PM they figured this out. On top of this we got no hotel! We had to sleep in the airport. They had us running all over the airport to talk to their reps and fetch our luggage. In the end Delta had a flight that left Newark today at 6:55am est and had us home at 9:30am Cst. It was very frustrating to be treated like we are nothing and then got a flight with Delta and were treated very well.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Santa Barbara via Denver. United Airlines is a disaster and has been for years. On time departures are unheard of. Very poor systems and customer service. I would love to say that I would never fly on them again, but due to the monopoly they have to most destinations in the country this is not a realistic option. I am literally in United Hell, with no end in sight. Avoid this airline at all costs if possible.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to Hong Kong with United Airlines. Not an easy and quick check-in. Plane looked aged, nice leg room space, good inflight entertainment and very good Wi-Fi and internet connection at a reasonable price (for the entire flight), terrible blankets. Very nice and gentle cabin crew. Food wasnÂ´t poor quality and quantity for a flight of 14h30.', \"united airlines â\\x9d\\x8e Unverified | Chicago O'Hare to Saginaw. What an awful travel experience. Our first United flight out of Chicago we had to deboard due to mechanical errors and missed our connection, we lost a day of our vacation and we're compensated nothing but a meal voucher and hotel room for the night. On our return through Chicago we boarded the plane and waited, again due to mechanical errors. We sat on the plane for another 50 minutes before being told to deplane. All these mechanical errors definitely make me very uncomfortable with the safety of this airline. I will never fly United Airlines again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Belize. Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever seen. If you can avoid this airline please do at all costs. The people working in the kiosk check in areas are the most rude, unhelpful people on this planet of ours. I don't know where United finds these staff, but they are the most incompetent I have ever dealt with. I fly very often for business and I must say of all the airlines I deal with United is, without a doubt, the absolute worst.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Aspen to New York via Denver. A family of 4 we were scheduled to leave Aspen airport 26th February at 7am. 5.5 hours before leaving, the flight was reported to leave on time. We arrived to the airport, checked in only 6 am at the gate we get to know plane is delayed till 9:30. We were lied that they had no crew but the plane is here. Its only an hour later we get to know the real story that plane never landed night before in Aspen and went to Grand Junction and now will arrive to Aspen for 7 am flight. None of that was reported on United website or app until 7 am and we had to wake up little kids at 4am and sit for hours in the airport not to mention missing the connection etc. What a disappointing way to treat customers!', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Miami. Horrible smells through the plane. A simple air wick will make all the difference in this plane. Literally it smells rotten this flight. The flight was also overbooked. Better to pay a little more money and avoid united airlines. When trying to get carry on bag into the plane, was informed by an operator that the cabins where full and had to a check the bag for 35$ which I paid gladly, but once I smelled this plane all my patience went to hell. Never flying United again.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Tampa to San JosÃ© del Cabo via Houston. Never had such consecutive horrible flights with one company! Left 3 hours late from Tampa because of maintenance issues. Missed our connecting flight to Cabo and had to fly to Mexico City to board this Aeromexico flight and have mechanical issues and delayed again. It will be an extra 10 hours of being in airports - they made it seem like they were really doing us a favor by offering a hotel room if they couldn't find a new flight. But instead they gave the two of us $20 in food vouchers in case we got hungry. That seems like a great tradeoff for an all inclusive day at a resort where we were suppose to be, with my husbands customers! I can understand when weather causes isssues, but both of these were mechanical issues with the plane.\", 'united airlines â\\x9d\\x8e Unverified | Denver to Atlanta. United Airlines does not care about customer service. I arrived early to Denver and there was an earlier flight to Atlanta. I had no luggage, there was an earlier flight with open seats. For a couple of keystrokes and $75 I could go on the earlier flight. This change would have made me happy and most likely someone would have been happy to take my spot on the later flight. This would have been win-win win with United being the hero. Now you are defined by your greed. I hope the loss of my goodwill and many others was worth the $75 you did not get.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to Denver. United Airlines, tighten up on your service. We couldn't take off for 20 minutes because of equipment failure - understandable. We landed and spent 30 minutes trying to find a gate. Almost like they were surprised we showed up. Then we couldn't make it to our gate on time because they failed to notify the next gate because it 'arrived on time', which clearly it didn't. We arrived 5 minutes before our gate, they close it 10 minutes prior. But no worries, it's actually better business that they do these kinds of things.\", 'united airlines â\\x9d\\x8e Unverified | The fact that I could avoid Frankfurt and fly directly from Houston to Munich is probably the best thing about this flight. The Boeing 767 is one of my favorite aircraft and it has a great interior and is well kept. The service was great, but the food was bad even by airline standards. I am probably one of the few people on this planet that enjoy airline food but this is simply not edible. For some reason their bread is called a 1234VR Brown Roll, I am not sure what it is and what horrible concoction of chemicals it inlcudes, but I cannot fathom why they would serve it to their guests. I miss the times when bread was just that bread, made with water, yeast and flour. The entertainment is a bit annoying as you are forced to view 2 commercials prior to any movies or TV episodes. The entertainment is also very lacking in general, the movies are very old as in HBO old. Nothing that is currently in the movies is shown.', \"united airlines â\\x9d\\x8e Unverified | Geneva to Denver. Absolutely horrible. We flew United for an eight hour international flight to our home in Colorado. Seat cushion was not attached properly and was horribly uncomfortable. Seats were far too close together (compared with Air Canada and others) and uncomfortable. Seat screen malfunctioning (both seats in the row). Staff was unfriendly (presumably because of the unhappy passengers and poor quality of aircraft). Such a disgraceful airline. Clearly United doesn't care because this is just one of many poor reviews and the custom satisfaction rating is quite low. Choose another airline for a long flight.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines canceled the flight from Newark to Burlington because of aircraft mechanical problems. There are no more flights on any airline from Newark or La Guardia for 3 days. They refused to give a voucher for a rental car or a hotel. Instead gave us 20 dollars of food vouchers to use while we wait for a bus to be arranged. But no specific time or actual promise of this bus ever appearing. The food voucher is worthless as well because it's the middle of the night and nothing is open here. Also, after canceling several flights for random reasons they only had 4 people working the customer service counter and two of them got up and left while there was about 60 people waiting in line. Complete lack of common sense or caring about people.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita on 18 December 2016. I was one of the last to board and had a window seat. The cabin crew took some time to realise that I have boarded but once they took notice, they quickly offered a menu for pre-flight drinks. The seat layout was the older Polaris product i.e. not all seats have direct access to the aisle. After take off, the crew came round to take orders for meals. The menu looked impressive but at least two of the meal options were not available which was disappointing. I had to go with my 2nd option but thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The service was attentive and pro-active with the crew doing rounds to ensure passengers' drinks are topped up, etc. I especially enjoyed the Sak's avenue blanket and large pillows. There were a thin blanket and small pillow available so passengers get to choose what works best.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington Dulles to Hartford and a terrible experience! United Airlines totally screwed up flights, refused vouchers, and bumped other passengers for a whole day due to broken seats. United Airlines used to be a great airline, now it is the worst ever. Best to look at another airline before you subject yourself to this carrier.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | The flight attendants were rude and too busy socializing with each other to notices the guests. I had to try 9 seat power outlets around me to finally find one that worked that I could charge my phone on. I bought an hour of internet for $8 and it worked for maybe 20 minutes. I flew from Chicago to Honolulu (9 hours) and they only gave us a cookie. Will not be flying United Airlines again.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to Auckland. Flight was very full as there is only one flight a day and the previous nights flight had left about 13 people behind due to being late off another United Airlines flight. This was fine we all got a seat but then sat for about half an hour to an hour on the plane as we waited for people coming off another flight, then waited for their baggage which seemed to have got lost. This is quite a late flight, we boarded at almost 11 pm at night so everyone was tired including the FA's. They seemed to be all tired, grumpy and not very helpful at all. I asked for a vegetarian meal (which is part of the standard meals now) and they gave me a chicken one - they weren't listening. The captain was great and kept us up to date. They tried to sell the premium economy seats a few times while we were waiting which is a bit annoying as they gave the impression the flight was full and it got everyone in a bit of a panic, especially the people who had been hanging around all day having missed the flight the previous night. They gave us dinner, a snake and breakfast. I slept most of the flight but it was bumpy and I put this down to going over the Pacific.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My experience with United Airlines has been very poor. My flight was a 32hrs trip from Panama to Singapore with a transit at Houston and an ther transit at San Francisco. My partner and I couldn't get a seat next to each other except if we had paid extra for it. There was no food and no TV in the first two flights. In Houston we had only one hour and half transit, but we had to get our luggage, pass the immigration and get in again. It's been very stressful in 1h30 to do that. We arrive at the gate just on time before they close, and the company was giving / selling our place to other people! Lucky we get there on time because they would not have waited for us! Service was poor and we finally got food on the last flight San Francisco to Singapore. The food was pretty bad. When we arrive in Singapore we tryed to get cash out, and we couldn't because we've got charged twice on our account!\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington to London Heathrow. A tatty and quite disgraceful ancient Boeing 757 for this transatlantic flight reminded me how far behind most of the world the US airlines are nowadays. Doesn't look like things will improve for either in the mid-term! I stuck with them for Star Alliance purposes, having flown out with Lufthansa - but what a big mistake. Staff at Dulles airport were brusque (if I'm honest they were just damn rude), boarding was very poor. Onboard, all I wanted was for the flight to end. A slop of a meal was served, but the worst part was gum chewing cabin staff who looked unbelievably scruffy, and 3 of them were literally bursting out of their uniforms everywhere. I love my trips to the USA and being there, but wow their airlines are stuck somewhere in the last century.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines is the worst airline I have experienced. We were on a connecting flight Cancun to LAX to Melbourne. Arriving in LAX we collected our luggage to re check in, to then be told you have to now fly to Sydney because you will not make the Melbourne flight. The Sydney flight was 10 minutes later then the Melbourne one! We then had to sprint to the other side of the airport with all of our luggage. Thankfully we are capable of running as there would be no way less able, families or elderly would have got there in time! The Sydney flight was waiting for us, we boarded. My husband was at the front of the plane and I was right at the back. I had been a signed a seat that was already taken 39E (written on my boarding pass) I approached the hostess to ask for some direction/ help, which to then I seemed to be a bother to her. I was then told that I was wrong and my seat is 40E. This seat was already taken as well! I was then finally given an empty seat.. Throughout the flight the hostesses were rude, very unprofessional and made you feel like you were a nuisance. The older hostess bumped into me with her trolley and huffed like it was the worst thing ever. They all talk and giggle in the back like it's a teenage house party, chew gum, their hair is a mess and their attitudes are disgusting. I felt so sorry for the one brillant hostess, she's holding them all up! For over 14 hours this is the last thing you want. I have not one nice to thing say about United, they ran out of eggs- no apologies. Just slammed down some pancakes with a sausage. And don't get me started on the bathrooms.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Sydney on Boeing 787. As one of the newer aircraft to United Airlines fleet I had expected a lot better than this. Seats are well below comfort standards of most Asian airlines, and whilst I had experienced some reasonable serviced in a couple of United domestic flights, the flight attendants on this route were simply abysmal. When they were visible in the cabin they seemed to spend their time smirking and chatting to each other and customers were second priority. It was like watching children misbehave and just embarrassing. On the one hand their profits shoot up, but what customers get is terrible. I don't understand why US travellers stay loyal to such a faded, out of date and poor airline, but guess it's all about flyer points. Food was passable, IFE was quite good, but the bad service overshadowed all of this - never, ever again with United.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | This was the first and last time I ever travel with United Airlines, and will advise others not to travel with this airline. We have always traveled with Qantas and United you have a lot of catching up to do. Flight attendants were rude and unhelpful, the female attendants grooming was appalling, and food was the worst I have ever had on a flight. The staff were too busy playing on IPads rather than attend a passenger in need. The seat did not go back on a 16 hour flight and the volume on the tv did not work.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Newark. We boarded, they kept us for 2 hours sitting in the aircraft without pulling away from the terminal, due to a leaking oxygen bottle in the cockpit. Then they made us offboard the plane for 2 more hours, so in total 4 hours delay. United Airlines generously gave us a voucher for 2.5 euros, yes, 2.5 Euros. Coffee at Amsterdam airport starts at 2.80 euros. Worst airline and service I ever saw, this seems to be a trend in airlines from the US flying from Europe to the US, planes and service are far from our EU airlines.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Fort Lauderdale. I fly about 150000 miles a year on United with well over a total of one million miles flown. I belong to their 1K frequent flyers. Among my many United flights I have randomly picked this one as an example. The airline has gone through many rough patches over the last couple of years. Poor management has led to very poor performance by the company as a whole. Unmotivated front-line employees, unresponsive customer service agents, older dirty planes remain a hallmark of United. Recently, the company has revamped their lagging international business class but the nicer pillows and blankets are not enough to cover up the many other deficiencies. The flight discribed here was a case in point: tired flight attendants, delays, lost luggage, helpless customer service agents lying about measures taken. This flight had all of the catastrophes that I have come to expect from United Airlines. Many people and United employees were hoping that a new CEO could turn things around. It didn't happen and in fact United continues on a downward spiral with no end in sight. I'm sorry to say that I can only confirm the many terrible reviews here on Skytrax .\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Kahului. We boarded what appeared to be a new plane, and prepared for our 9 hour flight. There were no televisions to be found on this flight to Hawaii, instead they want you to purchase their wi-fi. In addition they got passenger's seats wrong, families were broken up for family vacations and couples were split up who were on their honeymoon (us). No compassion, no staff attempted to right their wrong when we clearly picked our seats together before. Instead they left the scrambling passengers to swap seats, shuffling around attempting to get families and couples together. What a wonderful way to begin our honeymoon. Needless to say we will never fly United again. They clearly do not care about their passengers. Really no TVs on a 9 hour flight?! What a wonderful start to our honeymoon as I can barely see my new husband 6 rows in front of me.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to San Francisco via Fort Lauderdale. They have probably the worst customer service possible. After talking to their refund department several times and being assured that I had a $212.10 credit for my ticket, when I called to make an new reservation with my ticket (please note that I cancelled my reservation a month and a half before the flight), they informed me that I was going to be charged a $200 ticket change fee, a fee that I was not informed of by the three refund department people I spoke to. What kind of refund customer service wouldn't tell you that they charge a $200 refund ticket change fee when the ticket is only $212.10 dollars. After talking for a long time to their customer service, I gave up, and am no longer going to use United Airlines.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington Dulles to Toronto Pearson. On this day of travel, I needed to change my flight and the woman (I forgot her name) who helped me behind the desk did not know that if I didn't make it back to Toronto (because I didn't look ill) that I could have lost my vision permanently because I needed medical attention. I am grateful to United Airlines for accommodating my desperate need to get back to Toronto ASAP. I even tried to get help from Air Canada, who I usually fly with and they would not help me. But United Airlines was the only airlines who would help me. I will always remember United Airlines and the compassion and courteous help that the woman who worked behind the service counter gave to me. She also went above and beyond by giving me a confirmed seat and not a standby ticket. This is what all customer service should look like and I am thankful to United Airlines.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew for work from Los Angeles to McAllen via Houston. United Airlines did not give an excuse why the plane was late from the bay area to LA. That delay made me miss my connecting flight to McAllen. During this my luggage did not meet me at my final destination. Once my luggage arrived at my hotel it was broken. They tried to fix the problem but I still had to pay for new luggage. The return flight was worse - delay after delay and they had planes leaving to LAX. This airline needs to get their stuff straight. I will make sure not to fly United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Yesterday I traveled from Barcelona to Newark and was supposed to fly onto Austin. Once we landed in Newark, I saw that our Austin flight was cancelled. I am here to complain about the level of service that they gave to try to get rebooked. Once someone\\'s flight is cancelled, there should be appropriate staff to handle the volume. Every representative was rude, as if it is my fault my flight was cancelled. We were all treated like a nuisance. After going through customs, I was halfway directed to the customer service line. It was downstairs, so I tried to use the escalator across the way to go down with my huge international bag. An agent screamed at us that we could use the escalator right in front of us, to not use that one and clog it up. Well we told her the escalator is broken and we can\\'t use it. She didn\\'t care. For some reason we could not use use the escalator that everyone else 50m away was using. I am 7 months pregnant and carried my huge bag down those stairs. I unfortunately pulled a muscle in my stomach, I should have used it anyway but I didn\\'t. She still did not care. We then found the line. 100s of people were in it with two agents to help. We waited for over 4 hours. I got sick from not eating or drinking and being pregnant, but if I got out of line, I would have to start over. 30 minutes later the two agents tell us \"well we are off now, you guys have to call. Bye.\" They left us. A man yelled \"I\\'ve been on hold with them for an hour and a half already!\" Most of us in tears from being there so long. I was there 4.5 hours, I don\\'t know how long the people in the front were there. Unfortunately my phone was stolen in Spain, so I had no way to call. Simply stuck with no way to rebook. I finally found another flyer who let me borrow their phone. I understand cancelled flights, but you need to take care of your paying customers. I have never been treated that way. I am very upset, even today.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Miami. It was snowing all day in New Jersey, and I called to confirm whether my flight to MIA was delayed or cancelled and I was told it was not. I get to the airport and they delay my 8:50 pm flight about 6 times, to the point where it's 1 AM. They tell everyone the flight is cancelled because they cannot find a pilot. On top of randomly canceling the flight after the many delayed, they do not bother to accommodate us with a voucher for a taxi back home or a hotel. They just simply said to call the airline and book another flight. Not to mention how rude and unprofessional one of the ladies at the gate was. When I asked her for information on booking the next flight she gave me an attitude and didn't even answer my question. When I called their customer service phone number and spoke to a supervisor he as well spoke to me in a very unprofessional manner and seemed very careless to hear anything of what I had to say. He didn't bother finding me any sort of accommodation either. It was so unfair that I had to drive to the airport in the terrible weather, to 5 hours later be told the flight is cancelled. And then that I had to pay for my own transportation back home. There were so many angry customers because everyone was pretty much stuck st the airport and United Airlines refused to help! Terrible experience and I will never fly with them again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Chicago. First, we were late for takeoff by approximately 30 minutes, just sitting at the gate. While this isn\\'t usually a big deal, someone came on the speaker and said \"I\\'m really not sure why we haven\\'t been cleared yet.\" Really? Then why bother making the announcement? This lack of explanation was more concerning to myself and those was around me than saying nothing at all would have been. The seats were so close together, and I\\'m only 5\\'2\" and 110lbs. This airline offers no snack options for individuals with Celiac\\'s disease/gluten intolerance. Instead of giving passengers options from the cart, one flight attendant was giving everyone small blue bags of some sort of trail mix. The flight attendant had a cart full of snacks he could have been offering. When I asked if he had any gluten free options, he said \"I can\\'t tell you if it\\'s gluten free but you can look in the menu and try to buy something.\" He couldn\\'t be bothered with telling me the other options he had in his cart. When I looked at the menu the only completely gluten free option offered was a small bag of popcorn that costs almost $6. I asked the other flight attendant if there were any snacks like bananas, \"kind\" trailmix bars, or baked potato chips in the front of the plane. Her response was \"I don\\'t know but the snacks for up front are you know, for up front.\" So instead of sacrificing one snack item from the front of the plane that probably costs less than a dollar in actuality, both attendants left me with no food for the duration of the flight. I flew with Delta last week and they were much more accommodating and pleasant. While they did not have gluten free snacks in economy either, the attendants did manage to find a banana and a \"kind\" bar for me in \"the front\" of the plane, after I only mentioned my gluten intolerance to them once. In comparison, Deltas entertainment system is also far more superior to United\\'s. The only positive thing I can say about this trip with United is that my neighbor (after buying an hour of wifi for $8) did mention that the wifi connection was good. I\\'ve never had wifi connectivity issues on any plane though, so I\\'m not sure this says much.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Awful experience - that pretty much sums up a seemingly amazing trip turned upside down when my flight was delayed. It all started with a simple 30 minute delay, which then crumbled into a mess. The original time was 6.40 pm and that time was delayed three times. After the third time they delayed it for good, meaning United delayed the flight for 13 hours. If that was not an inconvenience I do not really know what is. Not to mention that I was also relying on a connection flight that I also missed because of the unclear reasons given. United did me a \"favor\" by booking me another connection flight with a 7 hour layover. I needed to be home that day but instead I get to waste 7 hours of my day in an airport. What makes this even worse is the fact that they did not compensate any of the passengers on the plane. Fast forward and it\\'s the next morning. You get up at 5 am and drive to the airport and get on the plane. The plane arrives at an airport where your connection is. Time is getting closer to the departure time and then it happens. The flight is delayed once again. This time it\\'s for 3 hours (keep in mind I needed to be home a whole day ago). Now they apologize and say they can\\'t do anything about it. This is probably the worst airline out there. United does not care about its passengers nor compensating the people they mess around.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Very displeased with United Airlines. Our flight from Omaha to San Francisco was scheduled to leave at 7.30am this morning. At 7.30am no one had started boarding and no one announced anything over the speakers. The screens still said the flight was on time. The delay time changed on the screen every hour, pushing the flight time further into the day. I am traveling with my cousin and the only way we found out about the delays were through automated text messages sent to her phone. No one announced anything over the speakers to us while we waited at the gate. I am fine with a delayed flight, but it\\'s been 8 hours. When we tried to ask about what was going on with our flight, the woman at the desk avoided all eye contact and walked away. We didn\\'t see her again. We went downstairs to the main desk and asked about other flying options and the woman at this desk said we didn\\'t have any other options. We hopped on the website afterwards and figured out we could change it ourselves. Very poor customer service. These workers don\\'t seem too concerned about answering any of our questions. Our flight was delayed so many times due to \"maintenance issues\" eventually they gave up and switched planes. The plane we are now on is apparently having problems too. We are all sitting on the plane waiting to take off after waiting for this flight. At least the flight attendants and the captain are nice.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Grand Rapids to Denver. Terrible airline, more times than not they are delayed by not only mins but hours when weather is perfect. One of my last choices. Air travel is good but don't expect to make your layover connection. I just not travel this airline when no other options for times due to work conflicts are available\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Edinburgh. This flight was a disgrace. We arrived at the airport and the ground crew who accepted our luggage was as unhelfpul and impolite. Our luggage was one kilo to heavy and the guy was making a big scene out of it, afterwards we just through a towel away and he was happy. The flight was horrible. I booked my flight on the lufthansa homepage, and if I would have known that I'm flying with United I would have never booked it. Just a brief look at the Skytrax rating showed me what I should expect and the reality is even worse. The entertainment system was broken, my front seat pocket was ripped, one toilet was out of order so lots of waiting people standing next to me during the flight. The toilet was filthy when I used it and the toilet seat was broken. This was just a horrible, terrible flight not worth a penny.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Minneapolis. I will never purchase a flight from United Airlines again. The overall experience honestly couldn't have been worse. I am an eternal optimist and frequent traveler, so it is very uncharictaristic of me to complain about travel experiences. Sadly, United Airlines has been a collasal disappointment. In one trip they have managed to delay flights for over 24 hours on the front end, lose luggage and currently delayed returning flights for 3 hours. Their customer service workers are incredibly rude and not helpful. I am honestly amazed that this company is still in business based on their poor customer service and apparent inability to run an efficient operation. Avoid this airline at all cost.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | New York La Guardia to Vancouver via Chicago. The New York to Chicago flight was nice trip and bumpy so service was suspended for safety reasons. Chicago to Vancouver a nasty air crew looking to upset customers. We sat in the third row or first of premium economy. We were ordered shortly after take off not to congregate or line up for toilets in the rear. Since we were up front making it to the toilet without anyone getting in front of you was impossible. Due to this fact I did not drink on aircraft as at 65 it can be painful to wait. We were offered no food as promised for our two hungry boys. They did get a third of a can of Sprite as this was their second long flight they asked for another drink of Sprite. They were refused. My wife asked for water instead politely. I asked for the purser to request an additional sprite as United advertises complimentary beverages. He did deliver. I thanked him profusely but now I was unbeknownst to me a marked man. I sat quietly until I was in dire need of a toilet. There were eight people in first class all sitting comfortably so I quickly used the front toilet. You would think I had threatened the aircraft. When I exited I was berated and demeaned by that same purser and ordered back to my seat. Where else I would go at 36,000 feet in the air was a mystery to me. I complied without incident. I did tell him quietly before landing he was a rude man for embarrassing me for using a toilet. On arrival the pilot came bounding out of the cockpit and had requested security at the gate. A toilet offense had apparently endangered the aircraft in some ridiculous fashion. He proceeded to lie about me talking to staff which had not happened. I was accused of blocking the aisle which had not happened. The security personnel dismissed the incident and we all went home. United is not passenger friendly and rather than attack or correct complaints they attack the complainer.', \"united airlines Flight #5953 - Kansas City snow storm of Dec. 17th. Flight was to depart at 5:22 pm. Delay, delay, delay then cancelled shortly before 8:00 pm. The lines of people at the gates were long and moving very slowly as people were trying to get other flights and airlines arrangements. At 8 pm an announcement that the agents at the gates had to leave for the day, as they had completed their shifts.....all hell broke loose as people began running from the lines out to the ticket counters in the terminal to be closer to the front of the long line. There was about 200 people in line for one agent. Other airline's planes were leaving, but not United's. It was communicated to the passengers that the one de-icing truck United had for Kansas City had broken a line and was inoperable. So, without de-icing, no flying. A neighboring airline had 4 de-icing trucks, however, three of those were broken so United couldn't borrow one. Really, in Kansas City, no contingent plan for snow other than one truck. Waiting in a line that wasn't moving, called customer service to reissue tickets on a different flight. We were told no planes were going to fly out the next day, Sunday, but they could get us on a Monday morning flight. The employee lied to get us off the phone and move on to someone else, by just scheduling us on an easy flight without having to do research of flights that would get us home sooner. However, we took the scheduling and headed to the bank of hotels to find a place for two nights. At the hotel we did our own rescheduling and found a flight for Sunday on another airline, American and Mesa through Phoenix, AZ, at 5:50 pm. These also, were delayed and finally left KC, MO at 8 pm. United's service is very poor, we did not get our upgraded seats we paid for, nor have they offered when we asked for compensation. The professionalism is lacking and not being prepared for in climate weather is absurd. There is so much more to tell of this terrible trip due to United, but don't we all?\", 'united airlines United Airlines (UA 419) from Seattle to Washington Dulles. Several aspects of this flight were exemplary. Check-in was quick, TSA Pre-check was immediate, and boarding was done with discipline. We pushed back a few minutes early, and with a very strong tail wind, we landed 45 minutes early. I had the window seat in the first overwing exit row, and the middle seat was empty, so the seating was quite comfortable. There were, however, two areas where United fell short. Warm breakfast meals are supposedly available for purchase, but by the 8th row of premium economy, all options were sold out. This was an early morning flight and the catering crew should have anticipated a higher demand for meals. My second observation concerns the in-flight entertainment. I have the United app downloaded on my iPad, so I was able to access a variety of movies free of charge. There is also a very inferior flight map with some aircraft data. The in-flight map on Lufthansa allows you to identify villages, lakes, streams and other geographical features. The United map gives you an approximate idea of what state you may be flying over. If the technology exists for better and more entertaining information, United ought to provide it.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Nashville. Was rebooked and had to pay for my own hotel room when United Airlines made us miss our connection from Houston to Nashville, when the flight from Cabo arrived late.

Of course, it\\'s United. Will never take them again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew LAX to San Antonio. Just minutes before boarding a 7.15 pm flight, we were informed that the captain was not there due to a misunderstanding of departure time. Further delays occurred due to lack of an open gate. 7.10 pm has now become 8.45 pm. I will do everything possible to avoid United Airlines in the future.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew with United from Raleigh Durham to Newark as part of a code share route to Fredericton, New Brunswick. Flight boarded early and left on time arriving a bit early in Newark. Flight crew were professional and pleasant. While IFE was provided via Direct TV, the system was difficult to turn off and passengers were subjected to an announcement / advertisement at the start of the flight which I personally found annoying. I did not really want to watch bad news on the TV screen and it took several tries to get it shut off. That and the fact that Newark is a pretty poor airport where the only issues with this flight. Passengers should be aware that a plane change in Newark may mean having to go through security screening again. This was the case for me in going from Terminal C to Terminal A. Wonder what passengers arriving from one of the nice European or Asian airports think when they arrive in such a scruffy airport.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I boarded United Airlines flight UA 83 on my trip back to Newark from Delhi. They had a full house but the service was pathetic. The flight charging points were not working, headphones were not working. They had a deficit of non veg meals and forced passengers to go for the vegeterian options. The flight crew was unattentive to the customer requests and were tough to catch. They even refused to provide drinking water and said the supply was over for economy class passengers just prior to the landing in Newark. The meal choices were limited and compared to Middle East carriers was nothing. When I spoke with the manager, he said that he is sorry for the state of things but could not help or compensate in anyway.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Vancouver to Denver. I wouldn't fly with United Airlines again. The service is bad and they just don't care about you. We wanted to get seats together, but that was impossible. They did not even try to ask the other passengers. We made a mistake with 1 letter of one of our last names and it was such a big deal to change it. It took the staff just 2 minutes to get it fixed but the drama they made. In business class you are not able to lie down. The food is okay - eggs and sausages, however not even a normal toast with it.\", 'united airlines Washington IAD to San Francisco with United Airlines. Despite my best efforts, my seat screen and remote control did not work.

No thank you, United.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flight from Buffalo to Newark delayed due to air traffuc control. Attendant in Buffalo said not to worry about connection because there were a lot of people connecting with me. Got to Newark, missed connection. Supervisor was rude. United would not pay for food, taxi or hotel. I slept on the airport floor. Then they flew me to San Juan instead of Aguadilla. I had to rent another car to drive 4 hrs to my destination. I also lost 1 day on my hotel, rental car and vacation. United said sorry we cannot do anything for you. The Buffalo attendant could have offered us the choice of staying home in Buffalo and leaving the next day.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Typical United flight running late from Little Rock to Houston. The worst part came when I was ask to leave my seat that I had paid an upgrade for and to go to the rear of plane so a family with child could have my seat.

So what was so special about the baby that bumped me from my seat?\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Made, confirmed and paid for a flight at 640p from Cleveland to Newark. Discovered less than 48hrs before departure that time/flight was changed by the airline to 8hrs earlier without notifying me. I called a spoke to two different customer reps. The first was not interested in addressing the changes to my flight and left me on hold for 1/2 hour after which I hung up. Called again 15 mins later where the second agent felt the need to provide misinformation, put me on hold and then hung up on me after a 20 min hold time. No matter what, this will be my last flight on United Airlines. They lack the ability to provide any degree of customer service even when they are in the wrong as clearly they are. They should be forced to close their doors and spare the consumer from even having them as an option for travel. I strongly suggest that the public avoid this airline at all cost. These types of issues speak to a greater problem United has.', 'united airlines Los Angeles to Dayton. This was my first and last time flying with United Airlines. The customer service was horrific. My connecting flight from Denver got cancelled and I ran to the customer service desk to find a huge line had already formed and there were only 2 people working behind the desk. I waited for over 3 hours to speak to someone - when I finally got to the desk the woman was completely unhelpful and rude. She offered some inconvenient flights that wouldn\\'t have gotten me home until late the next day. While in line I used my phone to find more convenient flights that I showed the woman and she says \"oh well I guess that would work too\". So I waited 3 hours to get absolutely no help. Since I was going to have to spend the night in the freezing airport, I asked if I could have a pillow and blanket for the evening (and I know they have them because they give bagged pillows and blankets to people in first class) - she told me that they don\\'t provide amenities to people with cancelled flights. I also asked if I could have a food voucher since I was going to be at the airport for an extra 14+ hours that I hadn\\'t planned on and she said they don\\'t provide food vouchers to people unless their flight had been delayed for four hours. No my flight was not delayed for four hours it was cancelled and I was at the airport an extra 14 hours! So I ended up paying an extra $35 dollars on horrible, overpriced airport food because of my cancellation. I spent the night shivering, trying to sleep at the airport until my morning flight. My morning flight was then delayed for 2 hours \"due to weather\" even though the pilot came out and said the flight was delayed because of a lack of crew. But of course the workers told us we did not get amenities or discounts because the delayed was \"weather related\". Once I finally got back to Dayton, after waiting around the baggage pickup for 25 minutes-I discovered my luggage was missing and customer service told me it was still in Denver! Once again they told me they don\\'t offer any compensation for the inconvenience. My bag didn\\'t arrive at my house for over 32 hours.', 'united airlines Newark to Rome. My wife and I were going to Rome to visit my son. Our flight was to depart on July 15th from Newark at 4:45 pm-to arrive in Rome the next morning. My flight number was LH7616, operated by United Airlines UA 40. After multiple delays, the flight was cancelled at approx 11:30 pm. United Airlines gave us a hotel voucher that took another 2 hours. Finally arriving hotel at 1:30 in the morning. We returned to the Airport the next day to attempt to leave once more. We were promised compensation by United Airlines and told to log in to their website under appreciation. Once I logged in, it did not recognize my flight number and could not proceed with my claim. My wife did write a letter to the airline and never received a response. This was 6 months ago and still have not heard anything. I will never fly United Airlines again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago O\\'Hare to Calgary. I bought a first class ticket at full fare, which was at least twice the coach fare. I had my seat selected and confirmed and paid in full of course. On the day of the flight I checked in. While waiting at the gate I saw on their United Airlines screen the names of 2 passengers upgraded to first class. Shortly thereafter I was called and I was told I was downgraded to coach because they were overbooked! They said they would give me a voucher of $250. I was appalled and I felt that I was cheated by United Airlines. The staff at United gate said they were overbooked and I was downgraded because my fare was the lowest of all the first class passengers on that plane. But I paid full fare and it was the lowest probably because I bought the ticket 6 months in advance - but it was a full fare and it was still more than twice the fare of coach. The staff member said I could either wait 3 hours for the next flight or fly coach this flight. I asked why they upgraded 2 passengers to first class and downgrade me when I paid full first class fare. This staff member denied that they upgraded anyone. (Another passenger whom I didn\\'t know later confirmed to me that she also saw on the TV screen 2 passengers upgraded.) I said I was going to complain because I felt that United Airlines cheated my money because I paid full fare for first class and they put me in coach for a voucher of $250. Their staff said, \"Go ahead to complain. I am just carrying out company policy.\" They never even apologised the whole time.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Having flown Business Class from Bangkok on a A380 Thai Airways to Paris to connect to United Airlines business Class to Newark, the difference was striking. The United much hyped Polaris business class product was disappointing. Unfortunately the Polaris seats and configuration is still the old narrow flat seats in the 2-4-3 configuration where all passengers don't have aisle access and window and middle seats have to ask the aisle passenger to get up. On my flight, there was a extra Polaris trainer on board for the cabin attendants but still the service was not smooth or elegant. Polaris is suppose to understand that rest and sleep is primary to the business flyer but the meal service took at least 2.5 hours with them still beginning to serve the ice cream when the lights were already dimmed. There was such a long time between courses as if the attendents didn't know what to do. I was seated next to the galley and watched them being disorganized and clumsy as the curtain was not closed. The Thai Airways personal cabin attendant knew my name as she introduced herself and all the courses, refill of drinks arrived swiftly and effortlessly like magic from behind a curtain. The cabin was always a sea of calm and tranquil unlike United noisy clatter. The one thing that was superior on United's Polaris was the cuisine. The salad was fresh and the courses plated well and restaurant quality. If only if United's Polaris could train their cabin attendants to a much higher standard of providing smooth professional service as if in a quality restaurant rather than a busy diner.\", 'united airlines Flew United yesterday and today from Chicago to Grand Rapids. Both had 3+ hour delays due to \"awaiting aircraft\". Hard to believe at one of their busiest airports or that other aircraft could not be used? When I went to customer service to switch to another airline to arrive a little earlier, I was told that they only do this when a delay is more than 4 hours. When I asked ab out the cause, I was told that weather was the main cause. When I mentioned that there had not been significant weather anywhere in the country for two days, the comment was that they were still recovering. I won\\'t fly this airline again unless I have to.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I flew UA895, 12/16/16 from Hong Kong to San Francisco, then UA 638 from San Francisco to Houston. UA895 was 12 hours long, and was advertised as having inflight entertainment and wifi when I booked it. The aircraft was old, so it had no personal TVs on the back of the chairs, just the main one near bulkhead. Not a big deal, but about 45 minutes into the flight, we were told the WiFi wasn\\'t working. They tried resetting it, then called tech support, but could not fix it. We were told that because it was considered a \"premium\" item, we wouldn\\'t be compensated. I didn\\'t expect compensation, but on a 12 hour flight, I expected some effort to be made to make everyone more comfortable. Instead, there were 4 children in our cabin and they took turns crying for the entire 12 hours. I understand kids cry, and I felt terrible for the parents, they looked fatigued. The kids would only stop crying when the parents walked the aisles with them or stood where they could see the TVs, which obviously wasn\\'t sustainable for a multitude of reasons. I imagine the flight would\\'ve been much more enjoyable for the parents, children, and other passengers if the wi-fi had worked. Additionally, even the entertainment on the screen near bulkhead crashed mid flight and had to be re-set, so even that was flawed. My second flight, UA153, was scheduled to depart at 12:05pm. At first it was delayed by 20 minutes, \"due to delayed incoming aircraft.\" I decided to look it up, and saw that the flight, UA424, Dulles to San Francisco, was originally scheduled from 08.50-12.06. Yes, the scheduled landing was for 1 minute after our flight was scheduled to depart. This is a terrible planning failure on behalf of United, who knowingly scheduled a flight they knew wasn\\'t going to depart at the scheduled time. Our flight didn\\'t end up departing until close to 2pm, after loading up around 1.15, and then taxiing for a long time. Multiple people on our flight had connecting flights, which were missed or they narrowly made it to, especially since United didn\\'t accommodate or prioritize their exit from the aircraft. This is extremely frustrating, especially knowing that United knowingly did this. There were over 100 people on the aircraft, all delayed an extra 1.5-2 hours, plus the people who missed their connecting flights and were even further delayed. United wasted 200+ hours of people\\'s time that day. It seems extremely fraudulent that they knowingly did this. Last, I\\'m taking time to write this review this time, as every time I have flown United, I have experienced a delay of at least 1 hour. It is extremely disappointing as a customer. For example, on our flight from ORD to HKG, we were delayed by almost 5 hours. On a flight I took from DFW to XNA once, I was delayed by 4 hours. Unfortunately, this just seems to be something you have to expect and plan for when flying United.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Orlando via Chicago. As an American citizen traveling domestically, over the past 15 years, I\\'ve come to set the bar about as low as it can get for flying. That said, I will never fly United Airlines again. Enough is enough. My boyfriend and I had pre-selected our seats, yet did not have seat assignments after checking in. It\\'s the holidays, so lines were long at check in. There was a woman in line with several suitcases, two of which were less than 4lbs over the weight limit. Instead of just taking pity on her and expediting the line by accepting her suitcases on the first, second, third and fourth times she repacked them, employees felt it was a better option to continue to hold up the line and create confusion as she kept having to drag her suitcases back and forth. Know when to just cut your losses. Because of the seating issue I was not able to sit with my boyfriend on the second flight. Upon landing, we learned that one of our suitcases was not on the plane, leaving my boyfriend with none of his things. We were told that it would be delivered to our hotel (2 hours away) by the end of the day. I am sceptical, but will see. My own brand new suitcase\\'s retractable handle is now completely broken and won\\'t budge from its retracted position. I was curtly informed that they are not liable for this damage. I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back, so it\\'s very uncomfortable if not painful to try and drag my suitcase around without a retractable handle. So thanks a lot for that, United. We paid $25 per bag for this \"service,\" but no refund was offered. And they\\'ll gouge us again on the way home. These weren\\'t cheap tickets, with the time of year. My money will never go to United again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Aruba to Washington. This has been by far the worst experience ever. I have never had so many hiccups in one day it\\'s ridiculous. I arrived to the airport 6 hrs early because of an emergency and I was not able to be moved to an earlier flight or wasn\\'t given the option to fly standby for \"open\" flights without a $75 fee. I waited for my original flight which wasn\\'t until 5:15 pm, just to get a text stating the flight was delayed one hour and fifteen minutes. The lady at the counter refused to look up my flight info and give me any options or additional information. I get on the plane at 6:07pm and sit until 7:45 because of issues with lighting. At this point I am now over 2 hrs behind schedule and the only accommodation they gave us were 9 movies to choose from for a 3 hour flight! The cable wasn\\'t available for free (as they stated) until the last 30 minutes of the flight. Once we land of course my connecting flight took off without me due to us being 2 hrs behind schedule. We landed at 10:27 and my flight left at 10:00. I waited in a customer service line until 12:00 midnight. The people at the desk were taking people out of order and had attitudes when questions were asked. I was refused a voucher for a taxi home the next day and told to go online. I was accommodated with a hotel that I didn\\'t get checked into until 1:40 in the morning with a shuttle coming to get me in two and a half hours. I was not able to locate my bags so I had to travel and stay at a hotel with nothing. I will never fly this airline again. They don\\'t accommodate you for anything. Their customer service sucks. I had to walk away from 3 employees because of their rude attitudes. The delays are uncalled for and a big inconvenience. Neither delay I had were due to weather!', 'united airlines Santiago to Denver via Houston with United. Today has been the most ridiculous travel day of my life. It started in Santiago as we boarded a plane for Houston. We ended up having a 3 hour delay due to a lack of \"maintenence papers\". Needless to say we missed our connecting flight to Denver. We were given another flight which we also missed because the bags took an hour and a half off of the plane. We then tried for 6 hours to get onto standby flight in IAH but we\\'re unable to, a fault of none. Busy travel days and large airports make for difficult travelling for everyone. The food or the seats on the plane weren\\'t really a problem either seeing as it should be expected that airlines are a pay to play service. Customer service, however, was unbelievable. We were lied to, ignored, spoken to rudely. Customer service lines took 3 hours to get to the front of and there was no noticeable attempt to fix it. However, not all of the customer service has been bad. The man who booked us our first two flights moved heaven and earth to re-book our first flight, and then get us another flight, with great difficulty, that same day. Besides him however, the United staff has been egregious. There is a line between doing the bare minimum of one\\'s job and taking away from the business that a certain employee works for, and I feel many of the employees are toeing, if not well over the line. I wouldn\\'t recommend United to anyone.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Omaha to San Francisco via Denver. Our flight was scheduled to depart on Dec 17th, 2016 at 6.10 am via Denver. Due to extreme weather conditions the flight was cancelled. After a long wait of 3 hours with only a single person to rebook all customers in other flights, we finally got our turn to speak with the staff. We were given only one option that is, \"You have flight only the following day and there are no more available for today\". I understood their situation as they could not provide me with any flight for that day as there are no seats available. After long waits we finally reached home with boarding passes for the following day. We woke up early again in the morning and checked the status online on United Airlines website. It mentioned there is a delay in flight timings but the scheduled time of departure is still shown at 6.10 am. I thought they will send an email or a text message incase if there is really one. And once again after paying for the cabs and reaching there on time we found that the flight is delayed by 4 hours. I felt deceived. I spoke to an attendant as to why I was not informed about the delay and she told I will get back to me in a moment and went on serving the customers at other kiosk without ever bothering to respond me. I then waited for 15 minutes to speak with another one and she asked how I made my resevation and I explained her it was through Priceline. And she tried to blame them as it is their fault and they have to inform me. I told her that these were new boarding passes which were issued by United Airlines at the kiosk. Her response \"Yeah right. I dont know\". I told her it is not a problem if there is a delay but it is your responsibility to inform me so that I would not have come early. Her response, \"I know but i cant do anything. You could wait at the airport or leave and then come back at around 9.30 am as that is when the boarding starts\". Is she going to pay us for the cabs? Cant they see what efforts we might have gone through to come to airport in the icy conditions with heavy luggage? She then tried to blame the weather when I told her the flight to and from the same locations in Southwest is running at scheduled time. Then she said, \"I don\\'t control anything here. I don\\'t know why the scheduled time in website was not updated\". In the end, I have to leave the counter with frustration. I dont see an inch of regret or an apology from their side for their mistake. We just sat there doing nothing and looked at the timings of other flights. There were few other flights whose status is either cancelled or delayed and all of them belonged to United Airlines.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Denver to Kansas City. No matter how many times I've flown with United Airlines in hopes their services would improve I have been constantly disappointed and today it reached my limit. Delays back to back with false hope for 6 hours. Their customer service is terrible, doesn't compensate for their shortcomings and is so confused and mismanaged. Customer service doesn't try to work with the customers plans which is frustrating and this largely falls on the head of management for not considering how much money the customers spends and they should up hold customer values instead of diminish customers probability of ever flying united.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Honolulu to Tulsa via Denver. I thought I would give United Airlines one more chance. Nearly every past trip with them has turned sour due to delays caused by flight crew absences or maintenance issues. I am now 6 hours delayed in Denver, and have talked to other people on this delayed flight who have been in this airport for over 38 hours! In my experience, United Airlines consistently fails to get their planes off the ground on time. In addition to delays, I always have a better quaity experience with other major airlines. For instance, during my 6 hour flight last night from Honolulu to Denver, we were brought drinks 2 times, and no snacks were offered. Last month on a very similar (yet longer, approx. 8 hour flight) trip with Delta, they provided two complementary full, hot meals, many rounds of drink service, and they even came through the cabin 4 times with individual 16 oz bottles of Dasani. I will never fly United again if given the option.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Manchester, New Hampshire to Norfolk VA via Newark. Extremely disappointed, only took one flight out of 4. Three cancelled flights due to \"weather\" on a non windy, rainy, or snowy day. Missed a once in a lifetime event, had to rent a car and drive 6 hrs to get to Virginia Beach, then on the day I am supposed to leave and return home had to buy a ticket through another airline because my original flight was also cancelled. Have been calling United since Friday (now Sunday) and still haven\\'t been able to get a hold of an actual person to discuss all the delays. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy, spend the extra on a more reliable airline.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Chicago. I'm extremely disappointed with the customer service and the fact that every time that my son or I fly with United Airlines, the plane is delayed due to aircraft maintenance. Why schedule flight when there is maintenance to be done? Additionally, today I was rushed to the kiosk after I told the attendant that I had a minor traveling alone. I had to go out of my way to get checked in and the young lady who helped us seemed confused with the process and wanted to charge me additional fees that I had already paid when I purchased the ticket. I will shop around for other airlines since my son travels at least four times a year, and I don't want to deal with this repetitive pattern again.\", 'united airlines Boise to Atlanta via Houston. United Airlines just cover their mistake.The flight was delayed for 13 hrs in Boise Idaho. Part for the delay was the weather and the last 3-4 hrs it was for maintenance. Counter customer service in Boise updated the new departing time over and over, repeating that there were doing maintenance. They promise that if we lose our connection I will have a hotel and vouchers for food. When I arrived at the United customer service at Houston Airport, they said that It was not a record of the maintenance. So weather does not pay for the hotel. They denied that it was maintenance. They said that airplanes usually have a few minutes or maintenance, not 3 or 4 hours. But that was that the counter people said maybe because they were anticipating not to pay us for the hotel', 'united airlines Direct flight from San Fransisco to Tokyo (Haneda) with United Airlines. Considering the ticket price, service was amazing. Where in most United flights economy class food looks small and not appealing at all, both lunch and breakfast tasted just fine. Due to maintenance issue, aircraft change had to be made and departure was late for 1hr. Full flight but in-flight service was with a smile and efficient. Staff quickly cleared the food trays after meal to make space for economy passengers. United does not charge economy passengers for American craft beers (Samuel Adams, Goose IPA etc) and some house wines which is another appealing point. Apart from the small PTV screen and the 1-hr delay, no complaints about this flight.', 'united airlines Flew from Washington, DC to Frankfurt. The flight took off at 10.00 pm and the dinner arrived 15 minutes later. The first drink service arrived 7 minutes after the meal arrived and the fasten seatbelt sign was removed after another 7 minutes. If you are expecting cheese and crackers, metal tableware, a hot disposable towel and a free after dinner drink, you are on the wrong airline. United does not provide this. That did occur on my Lufthansa flight the next night. United provided a second drink service with a glass of wine complementary. A red sherbet dessert was provided along with a small bottle of water but the sherbet contained so much red dye, I was sorry that I ate it. Lights were out quickly after the second drink service. Breakfast was a piece of bread, yogurt with a third beverage service. If you are trying to maximize sleep, United might be the airline for you. I would have preferred a beverage before the meal arrived.', 'united airlines Louisville to Reno via Denver. We were in a group of 22 people headed to Reno for vacation. Mechanical problems delayed our flight to Denver by 2 hour 30 min, resulting in missing our connecting flight to Reno. The United Airlines staff manager tried to get Denver to hold plane but to no avail. She announced that once we reached Denver go to the United customer service and that accommodations would be provided for us and United would find flights for us the following day. We did just that and we were told they knew nothing of that. Customer service proceeded to tell me and my friend that they had 2 seats to San Francisco and a 5:52 flight to Reno. We arrived in San Francisco at 4:30 pm and was told the flight to Reno was cancelled, and the 10 pm was booked. We were on standby and they delayed the Reno flight until 4:30 am.

Every step of the way, United appears to have no interest in customer service. Telephone representatives make no effort to be helpful. Crew, for the most part, are not friendly and perform minimally. Extremely uncomfortable planes made even less comfortable with such poor attitude on the part of crew members. No way to reach anyone in Customer service by phone. They simply show no interest in pleasing their customers. The worst airline experience.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Syracuse to Ontario via Newark. I arrived to my flight 2 hours early. I\\'m active duty military so I got through TSA fairly quickly, and proceeded to my gate. About an hour before boarding I got a text that said my flight would be delayed till 11pm (5 hour delay) due to \"awaiting aircraft.\" This made me slightly mad due to the fact that I don\\'t understand why an airline is selling tickets for a flight they can\\'t even provide an aircraft for. I was then told I could fly down to Washington DC at 11pm, arrive at 1am and have to sit there till 830am to make my next flight. I was supposed to be at my final destination in California at 730am, so I accepted it and went to the USO to relax till my 11pm flight. A couple hours before that I got a text that said my flight had been cancelled due to \"operations.\" I won\\'t be getting home until 3 in the afternoon now. United Airlines needs to get their customer service up to par. Don\\'t sell tickets if you can\\'t get your customers to their destination. If it was bad weather I could understand that. But not having a plane available? That\\'s unacceptable in my eyes.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Well both my flights from SAT to ORD were late departing which resulted in me arriving an hour and a half late. When I got to the airport they changed the departure gate 3 times without any notification, I thought I had signed up for the flight text alerts. I could have possibly missed my flight if I had not asked someone where they were going after sitting at the wrong gate for an hour. Finally I get on the plane where the flight attendants were really rude for no reason about people changing seats when the airline had over booked the flight. It was just a mess and next time I will be flying Southwest.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Raleigh Durham to Washington. United Airlines is one of the poorest airlines I have flown. Ground staff don't have a clue about when delayed flights are leaving or how you might get information. Flight crew couldn't even tell me the duration of the flight, even after departure and walked up and down cabin while explaining emergency procedures making it impossible to understand. Seats were most uncomfortable I have sat in. The backs seem to keep you leaning forward with an odd curve and the leg room is very tight. This airline should be shut down. The only reason I will ever take them again is because they are cheaper than others, but unfortunately this comes with great compromises to comfort.\", \"united airlines Minneapolis to Charlotte via Chicago O'Hare. How a 40 minute layover turned into five and a half hours. After a late arrival, a shuttle to a connecting flight 350p that left early. Not to fear, United Airlines rebooked me on a flight leaving 2 hrs later. So I thought. The new flight was delayed 5 times before I called customer sevcice to find another flight. I was then booked on a 3rd flight out of Chicago, the CSR never sent the confirmation I requested. Finally at the counter to check in for a 9pm flight arriving in Charlotte at midnight, I was greeted with an attitude, my question ignored and now I sit waiting for boarding to begin late. Terrible!\", 'united airlines The Polaris disaster with United Airlines. Washington IAD to Zurich on a 767-400ER. Same seat as before, but with a bunch more stuff, including a â€œpolar bearâ€\\x9d teddy bear, so thereâ€™s no space to put anything. Of course, having a teddy bear didnâ€™t guarantee that Iâ€™d have a menu (which I had to ask for) nor an amenity kit with ear plugs - which I sorely needed because the guy beside me started to snore loudly just after takeoff. Once the bell indicated that the crew could get out of their seats and start the service, I used the FA call button to ask for an amenity kit to get some ear plugs. The FA working in my section came to me and said that I should not to use the call button because it was loud and would disturb other passengers. His telling me that woke up the guy beside me. So much for not disturbing other passengers. I was amazed and annoyed. Iâ€™ve never been told in a premium cabin on any carrier not to use the call button. Why did I have to use the call button? I got on board and had no menu, no amenity kit yet somehow I had a teddy bear, pillow, two blankets and a rude flight attendant who told me to just signal him when heâ€™s in the aisle. I did that and got an arms crossed â€œwhat would you likeâ€\\x9d rude stare. The movie selection consisted of exactly six movies. My tray table would not come out, so I had to leave my seat while the same FA who told me not to use my call button yanked on it to the point where it finally ejected from its slot, but, in the process, toppled over my drink. Now a piece of the siding underneath where the table is stowed is unhinged and flapping loosely. Whoâ€™s got a piece of tape? To top it off, my appetizer was frozen (including the salad) and the bread was cold and stale. Good luck, UA, with Polaris. So far, not impressed. Same miserable UA crew with bad attitudes (although the Cabin Service Director was polite and apologetic when I told him what his colleague had said to me about the call button). This has been a rude awakening after regularly flying Qatar Airways for the last two years. While this flight is qualifying me for 1K status for all of next year, fortunately, it is the only UA-operated segment I have on this around-the-world work trip. Good riddance, United. You blew it with this otherwise loyal customer. A dreadful experience all around.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | ROC-ORD-SFO-HNL-GUM-PVG, economy I feel United has lost its plot. It used to be the best US airline but it is clearly not anymore. I had a single ticket for 5 flights and had lots of issues. After receiving my tickets in ROC, my name did not appear on the boarding list in SFO, thus I had to wait for nearly one hour before getting a seat. There was no IFE in most of flights: although Wi-Fi was supposed to provide access to movies, it did not work in any of the flights I took. On the flight GUM-PVG the IFE was in the form of small screens at the back of the seat. Movie selection was poor. Flights were mostly late: SFO-HNL was more than 1 our late. I was upgraded to premium seats on the SFO-HNL and HNL-GUM flights. Seats are OK. Although we were supposed to receive a meal on the GUM-PVG flight, I did not receive any food. The positive aspect is the cabin crew, that has always been attentive and professional. The flight cost was OK.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I was flying to Chicago for a conference. My flight was to depart from San Diego at 1.30 and arrive at 7.30 local time. Upon arrival at SD I was informed the plane was experiencing \"mechanical issues\" AKA \"we undersold the flight and are going to merge it with another\". The attendant offered online vouchers which he said would be available after the flight had departed. They weren\\'t. I am a celiac and I did not pack food because I was having dinner in Chicago that night which, I missed. Airplane food at best is inedible but add gluten free and you\\'re stuffed. I packed nothing because I didn\\'t think I was going to need to. Error! The flight landed in O\\'Hare at 10.30pm and of course everything on a Monday was shut. By the time I got to my Hotel room and went back out to look for food it was 12.30. Upon return that week I wrote to United as speaking to a human is impossible. Anyway they were so generous in offering me a whole $50 dollars in flight vouchers. Luckily I won\\'t be able to cash them in because I would never fly (voluntarily) United. It was the second time this year and the last for a long time I hope. The few dollars saved just didn\\'t add up the the trauma of flying with this outfit. Never again.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I will never fly United again and this is why. I was to depart Cleveland to Chicago on 26 November at 6:35pm. We did not leave the runway until 8:25pm for a fuel overfilling. I have never heard of such a thing! There 4 updates given and they were not timely and obviously they were not accurate. We arrived in Chicago at 8:38p. My connecting flight was to depart Chicago at 8:50pm and boarding stopped at 8:35pm. I asked several flight attendants if my gate could be called and I was told they couldn't control that. It seemed like I was the only person on this plane with that connecting flight. There were others going to Istanbul Turkey that United called ahead for them not to miss their connection. An announcement was even made that they didn't need to rush. When we landed in Chicago I had to run from gate B14 to E1. I have never run so fast, in heels, in my life. When I arrived at E1 the plane had pulled away. I was livid! I went to a customer service counter for assistance and was told there were no more flights leaving Chicago to Milwaukee that night and that I could take a bus. A bus? I didn't want to but I was ready to go home to say the least. The time then was 9:00pm. I was told the bus wasn't leaving until 10:45p and it was the last bus. Arriving Milwaukee at 12:30am. I inquired about my luggage and was given instructions on how to get it. After going to another service counter, I was able to get my luggage, 20 minutes later. The second service counter attendant told me the bus shuttle was right outside the door and to follow the red Bus Shuttle sign. She even pointed to a Coach bus going by telling me that's where I'd get on the bus. I hadn't been on a bus since I was 12 years old. She offered and gave $20 worth of food vouchers but I didn't use them. I was too distraught. I sat in the terminal waiting to go to the bus stop. At 10:15 something told me to go and find out exactly where I needed to stand. I asked an airport shuttle driver and he told me to follow him. He pointed to shuttles/buses that were across the street and about a 10 minute walk away! I had to run again, this time with luggage. As I entered the bus terminal there was no one available to ask which stop, 4, 5,6, etc, I was supposed to stand near. I asked the transit cop and he told me to stand at #4. I asked what time was the bus coming. He said the bus usually gets there at 10:30pm. My watch said 10:32p. He then said he must be running a little late. I didn't want to take any chances so I stool outside the terminal, right in front of the #4 stand, waiting for the bus. Once on the bus, the driver announced since this was the last bus of the night he had to wait an additional 10 minutes before departing. I arrived at the bus station in Milwaukee WI at 12:38am. For a travel trip that should not have been more than 50 minutes in the air, I ended up spending almost 9 hours to reach my destination. To say this is unacceptable is an understatement.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Phoenix to Bangkok via Tokyo with United Airlines. I purchased my tickets predicated on scheduled departure, layover time and cost. After committing to my flights 5 months prior to the departure date the departure and layover times were changed 4 times. I contacted my booking agent and United Airlines and neither were sympathetic to my problem. They have you sign off on each change to ensure you don't take advantage of the accumulated delays which would warrant some compensation in the form of changing flights more to my requirements. Now for the entertainment on the flight. The video would stall every 10 minutes and you would loose 10 seconds of the movie. Overhead old style screens made it difficult to view from my window seat. United online movies would have been an option but without a power charging jack it was not an option. Food was terrible on the United leg of the flight. Soggy breaded chicken swimming in sodium laddened gravy. The ANA flights provided exceptional quality on both food and entertainment. Price was good but I question the true value. I will opt to fly on a more expensive higher quality airline next time.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Original flight with United Airlines flying from Leon/Guanajuato to Los Angeles delayed due to mechanical problem.

Our flight from Washington DC to Liberia (Costa Rica) via Houston first gets delayed for 6 hours under the pretense of weather, to only be cancelled at 2 pm when guests were expecting to board without any advance notice. We had a family member that flew on Southwest and were able to travel and at no point was the flight cancelled due to weather. Same departure city Houston, same time 9 am, same arrival time 2 pm, instead we are not only kept in the dark but left with the responsibility of finding accommodation until tomorrow - meanwhile we are now paying for two hotels, one in Houston away from family, and in Costa Rica where we should have been. I expect a better solution and outcome then a deeper hole in my pocket. This is unacceptable.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Charleston to Hancock via Chicago. United assumed operations to my hometown from Delta a few years ago and the service has become garbage. Almost every flight I've been on has been delayed or canceled. Every time I fly there it's a toss up whether or not I make it and chances are good I won't make it back to work on time. If given the option, take a different airline. In addition to their inability to manage the flight leg, their planes have uncomfortable seats and are usually too hot. If anybody from United reads this, you should go talk with a Delta rep and learn from them.

Looking more like noon now.\", \"united airlines Los Angeles to San Francisco. Had a very pleasant flight with United Airlines. Even though we had a delay out of LAX because of weather at SFO. The delay ended up being 2 hours. For the first part of the trip we sat at the gate at LA, but eventually pushed back and sat out on the tarmac somewhere until we got clearance from San Francisco. Understandably some passengers were upset because of possible missed connections at SFO, but weather is what it is, and an airline can't help that. Some opted to disembark before we pushed back from the terminal. The pilot was very courteous and apologetic. You could tell he cared as he tried to work whatever magic he could to get us out as early as possible. He was even apologetic over the the way some of the ground crew was apparently dealing with customer concerns which he felt wasn't totally what it should have been. Some things he apparently overheard and apologized for. The cabin crew onboard the flight was pleasant as well (though I think it would have been cool if they had offered water, or peanuts or something as we sat waiting. Since we really didn't know how long it was going to be.) Still I felt the flight and cabin crew handled it as well as they could. And I got a great price (even with the upgrade, which at 6'3, the extra leg room was nice considering the predicament that ensued).\", \"united airlines Knoxville to Milan via Washington IAD with United. First flight delayed for an hour leaving me 8 minutes to get across Dulles Int to my connecting flight. Upon landing at Dulles, the ground crew took forever to get the stairs to the plane. When I got to my gate the flight had departed. Had to visit their customer service and have never been treated so badly in my life. Several people already lined up for the agents and when I finally got to the agent, she informed me that she wouldn't help me because she was now off duty. I had to get back in line and wait even longer. They did book me on another flight but left me waiting in the airport for 19+ hours. Absolutely the worst I have been treated in 30 years of travelling. I will never book another flight on United again.\", 'united airlines Flew IAD to BRU with United. United business class is really substandard. The seats are very cramped and not comfortable at all. They put 6 seats in a row (very narrow seats, no privacy, no place to rest your arms) which means United Business Class is more like a Premium Economy but sold at the same price as the much better business class seats offered by airlines from Europe or Asia. The food and service are also rather poor. The lounge is poor (they even charge 5 US$ for a Sam Adams beer even for passengers that paid international business class) with little choice of food and no pre-dining options. Avoid flying United Airlines if you can. Airlines from Europe or Asia have a much better product to offer for the same or lower prices.', 'united airlines Horrible customer service. Our inbound flight arrived on time in Dulles and we made it to the gate with little time to spare. After 20 minutes we had a flight delay of 2 hours. While waiting in the customer service line for quite some time the flight changed again and again and yet again. Apparently the plane had already been sitting for 3 hours with mechanical issues. The flight was ovebooked by 5 seats. One by one all of the PA flights were getting delayed. We just wanted to obtain our luggage, get a rental car and go home. The very rude customer rep basically told us we were crazy saying it was overbooked and it was impossible to get our luggage. Finally our flight was canceled. We were offered a bus service. All we had to do was go here, then there, then here and then there again. United had very little contact with the shuttle service people and did not want to deal with us any longer. After a total wait of 4 hours getting the run around and lied to and treated like this was our fault we were finally on the road back to PA. While we should all be tuckedd away at home at the early hour of 1 am we will be lucky to make it to HIA and then get home before the sun rises. Any travelers looking to utilize United, do yourself a favor and choose a better company.', \"united airlines United Airlines from Albany with a connecting flight in Newark to Montego Bay in Jamaica. We got to the airport early, boarded our plane on time (United Express Plane), first flight of the morning, and had to deplane due to a hydraulic pump failure. So all 11 of us went back into the airport and we're told it was a quick fix. About a half hour later we got back on the same plane, took off and we were in the air for 10 minutes, and then told we had to go back to Albany due to the same pump failing again. Why was this not tested in the morning before the first flight goes out? Why would we get back on the same plane with mechanical issues? So after getting off the plane for a second time we went back to speak with the gate staff who were less than helpful. None of them knew what was going on, no updates were provide and none of them spoke English clearly. We ended up mapping our own way from Albany to Philadelphia, Philadelphia to Miami, spending the night in Miami, and getting to Jamaica the next day by noon. All of these inconveniences will be paid for by United, and they even sent us each $50 vouchers, which we will not be using because we plan to never fly with United again. The story doesn't end here, our flight from Jamaica to Newark boarded late, no big deal we got there. As soon as we landed we were notified that our final flight from Newark to Albany had been delayed over 2 hours with no explanation. So, we sat in the airport for another 5 hours, not receiving updates as the gate staff still did not speak English, and were sarcastic and rude, as if our questions were stupid. Finally we boarded the express plane (that smelled like it had never been cleaned before) at 10:30, just making it out of Newark for the night and landed in Albany a little before midnight. We lost a day and a half of our vacation, spent hundreds of extra unplanned dollars and even considered just going home all because of United Airlines. We will not be using our vouchers they gave us because we will not be flying with them ever again. We will be flying with Southwest from now on like we used to. We tried United due to the travel agent and the package selected by our family members. United was an absolutely horrific experience. Their planes are old and they have an incredibly unfriendly staff.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Honolulu to San Francisco with United Airlines. Flight attendants rude - had multiple flight attendants bump into me with carts with no apologies. Offered 1 complimentary soda, with optional water now and then. Seat tv controls were located on top of the armrest which provided no room for my arms to rest without adjusting multiple aspects of tv. That was only if the any type of entertainment was offered for the 6 hour flight. Had to use my ipad for entertainment. On the way back they would not offer internet due to unavailable for transocean flight, (even though it was on the previous flight to Hawaii) which price for both flights were identical. United offer a direct tv option only with excessive credit card charges. It should also be mentioned that they even showed pricing for flights that were over 2 hours were charged more per movie. Boarding agent almost would not to let me take my normal sized carry on, due to space limitations. When all I had was on small bag that fit in all there metal measuring racks. After telling her I was not checking my bag got on the plane and there was so much space in the overheads that some remained open after passengers were all seated. I cannot believe how far standards have dropped for airlines.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to Venice via Newark. We sat on the tarmac in Orlando for 2 hours with very little air conditioning. The delay was because of lightning and I do understand that but we were given a plastic cup of tepid water during those 2 hours. When we spoke to the flight attend to let her know we had a connecting flight in Newark to Venice (there were others on the flight who also had connecting flights overseas). When we told her she assured us that because it was another United Flight they would call ahead and let them know we would be delayed and to hold the flight. She also told us we would be arriving at the same terminal as our departure terminal C. She assured us she would allow the passengers with connecting overseas flights to disembark first. None of this happened! The fight arrived at 6:35, we arrived at terminal B, she did not get us off the flight first, and no one had called ahead to hold the flight. I have heart problems and my husband And I ran through the airport where I started to feel like I was going to have a heart attack. We managed to wave down a cart and he took us the rest of the way. We got to the terminal where our flight was leaving from at 6:45 the lady at the desk said run down and get on the flight - only to find the door had been closed. The flight departure time was 6:55! I was so worn out by this time we walked back to the front desk and she said she would call operations - they got permission to open the door and let us on. When we went to find our seats there were people sitting in them so we stood trying to see what to do. Eventually I said to a flight attendant who was ignoring the situation do you think you can help us. She came and walked us round and round to try to find seats for us. I spotted two seats across the aisle from each other and said we will take those seats. I would also like to remind you that we booked this flight and our seats in May 2016. Not very happy with the experience and have written to United Airlines head office with no response at all. I guess they are thinking we will go away. That will not happen I will put this on social media I can find until I get a response.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Savannah with United Airlines.

My friend and I were going to Orlando and chose United Airlines because they were most convenient. On our way down to MCO we had a connecting flight in Newark, NJ. We boarded the plane as normal in Hartford and we were on it for 2 minutes before being told to get off because there was something wrong. We departed the plane and was out for another 2 minutes before telling us to reboard. We couldn\\'t take off right away which made us late and when we finally did we knew we weren\\'t going to catch the next flight. They told us to just go to customer service and get a new flight. When we reach Newark, we did just that. We got another flight pretty close to the other one. We boarded like normal, and five minutes in, they tell us they have to change the brakes. They said it would be a 30 min job. After that, they said they had to change a tire. That was supposed to be another 15mins. After that, they broke a piece and we weren\\'t going anywhere. After that, they got a new piece and we were going. 20 mins after that we were finally in the air. We didn\\'t land in Orlando until after 2pm, when we were supposed to be there at 11am. They offered us free alcoholic drinks because of the long wait. When my friend and I ordered she rudely asked for ID like we were lying or something and then made us split a drink instead of giving us one each. 4 days go by and it was time to go home. I received a text the morning of my flight (3am) saying that my flight will be delayed. This was the 3rd flight to be delayed. I had to go to Newark before Hartford as it was my connecting flight again. When we arrived at the airport and got to our terminal we asked about the delay and what to do about our connecting flight. The man at the desk said, \"I believe you will still make it, I can move your seats closer to the front to make sure you get off the plane in time.\" We obviously believed him. It took us a while to get in the air and when we landed we rushed off and ran to our gate. It was closed. When I asked the man at the counter about it he said \"listen, I didn\\'t work the flight.\" I never asked if he did. I was then told to go to customer service. When I did so, the woman said she would put us on the 9:30pm flight to Hartford since that was the one leaving next. I was supposed to be in Hartford at 4pm. I didn\\'t want to be in the airport for another 6 hours and get home by 10pm. I mentioned renting a car because Newark was 2 hours from my home and she said that United will not pay for it because they\\'re offering me a 9:30pm flight as compensation. She then stated, and I quote, \"Well, you know what, you\\'re here. At least you are here.\" I was not only taken aback by the airlines ability to have broken planes every time I was supposed to board one, or the fact that they kept making me miss my flights, but I was unbelievably astounded at the constant rudeness, unhelpfulness, and overall attitude I received the entire time.', \"united airlines New Orleans to Seattle via Houston with United Airlines.

Dublin airport offers pre-clearance and as such I was attracted to the flight with United Airlines. First impressions count and I am afraid that I was not at all impressed with the gate staff â€“ some of whom were in United uniforms and boarded the flight after their gate duties. Their rudeness towards an elderly couple was disgusting and simply ignorant. Boarding was done in groups. Some passengers did not have their groups shown on their tickets and the staff had an aloof manners towards those who simply asked for the process to be explained. One staff member was particularly rude and obnoxious and seemed to enjoy being so. The flight is operated using a Boeing 757. The aircraft is rather comfortable but compact. The safety procedures were taken seriously and a video shown. During this flight I had to contend with an malfunctioning inflight entertainment system. Only a few TVs worked and the sound / volume was not controllable. The journey map did not work properly as only the distances were displayed. The couple next to me gave up on their IFE as theirsâ€™s did not work either. My arm rest was not working correctly either. The catering was good and drinks were served regularly during the flight. I was impressed with the captain who made clear announcements and was very professional and welcoming. The Captain made a point of saying farewell to departing passengers in person. I had to collect my second boarding pass in Newark and the first uniformed United staff member I spoke to was indifferent and made no effort to even speak to me but pointed me along the concourse. The second uniformed United staff member I spoke to get my boarding pass was actually very friendly and polite and informative too. I also had positive impressions of ground staff who operated the transfer bus between terminals and could not praise them enough for being helpful.

We were really disappointed in the service, or lack thereof, provided on our United Airlines flights to and from Hawaii. It is quite ridiculous that the only food available on an 8 hour flight is offered for a ridiculous fee.

This is the first time I have flown United for a number of years and was apprehensive after reading all the bad reviews. After four flights with the airline I was quite impressed and would fly them again. The Boeing 777-200s used are showing their age with one plane still having an ash tray in the toilet. Good selection of movies to watch on the seat back tvs though the screen size is on the small size. Food was rather poor but come to expect that, beer and wine is free on international flights and there were frequent runs for water, tea and coffee and a nice touch that ice cream was offered mid flight, and just before landing they give you a cold snack. Flight attendants worked well during the flight and kept the passengers well fed and watered. All flights departed on time and arrived at the destinations early, the IAD-LHR arrived 50 mins early being a 6.20am arrival meant an easy exit through border control, getting luggage and exiting the airport in 20 mins. Would fly United again if the price is good.', \"united airlines Worst airline ever. I have a $561 credit with the airline and they are making it impossible to use. When I finally was able to reach an agent that spoke English, I was told that I had to physically pay United $200 to just use the credit. The $200 was not taken off the original $561, rather, must have been paid via credit card. The flight I needed was $170. On top of the $200 United already wanted me to pay, they were going to charge me an additional $200 to change the flight, $100 to book the flight through United and not a travel agent. In essence, I would actually be paying United close to the $561 credit owed to me for a $170 flight. Additionally, I spoke with three agents and all of them were rude and disrespectful. I was hung up on twice and the first person I spoke with could not speak English. I'm stunned that I have to pay to use a credit owed to me. It's not surprise that the airline is rated the worst airline and will most likely be bankrupt within the next few years. This company is crooked and I wouldn't recommend this airline to my worst enemy.\", 'united airlines Newark to Los Angeles return. My flight to LA was fine and had no hiccups. My flight back home from LA however is another story! My flight was at 9:55, my friend and I were waiting at the gate (the gate listed on United\\'s app which was verified by the employee\\'s of the airport). At 10:00 we are looking at each other wondering why boarding or no announcements were made on the PA system. We go to customer service to find out that they made a last minute gate change (this happens often in airports and I\\'ve never had a problem catching flights using the App or listening to PA system). We were told we could be put on standby for the last flight that evening or have seats for an 8am flight the next day. Due to the fact that the gate change was not announced or alerted through the app we were not the only passengers having this problem. We later realized that they never made the announcement because they have over booked multiple flights and needed extra seats! After we were not able to get on our standby flight - due to overbooking, they asked for volunteers to give up their seats to be able to fit other passengers- We had to sleep in the airport (we asked for hotel accommodation and were told we would be reimbursed however the \"volunteers\" got vouchers right away). After sleeping in the freezing cold airport and finally boarding our flight, while giving our boarding passes we were told our reservation was canceled! The look of complete shock and anger was extremely difficult to hide and the customer service/flight attendant informed me that, \"If I wanted them to help us I would have to remove my attitude\"! I did not even utter a word out of my mouth towards them to be met with such a comment? I let them know that it was their job to help me and no one was doing any favor\\'s here. How appalling to have missed your flight, through no fault of your own and to be tossed around being reassured your tickets were confirmed and that everything was going to be okay only to be served with sass?! Mind you the entire customer service experience from since we missed our flight was horrible. Everyone had an attitude and blamed the passengers for their experience. I\\'ve never had this kind of experience when I\\'ve paid for a service/goods. My recommendation would be to give customer service and flight attendants courses on how to deal with customers. Overall I will never use this airline again. My only good comment would be for the staff on-board the plane. They were very pleasant and thoughtful.', 'united airlines Our flight from New York LaGuardia to Traverse City was delayed for approximately 2 hours which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. Understandably bad weather, mechanical difficulties are things you just can\\'t predict or change. However the reason we were given was that we didn\\'t have a pilot as our pilot called in sick and it \"slipped\" through without another picking it up. After boarding we were told to get off the plane and then mid disembarking we were told we didn\\'t have to. I will never fly with United again. Nice planes but the 66% reliability they receive as an airline isn\\'t worth the extra frills.', \"united airlines United Airlines cemented its place as the worst airline company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Other than small things like not giving us the seats we chose or putting my wife and I together, we had multiple delays, a very hard landing, unfriendly attendants and customer service. The whole experience was horrible and my wife and I were glad it was almost done with when we landed in SFO, our transfer point back to Tucson. Unfortunately it wasn't. I am now waiting for an hour or more for my bags as our flight was cancelled and I am now booked for another flight tomorrow to Denver and then finally Tucson (lets hope). The service reps were the most rude and unfriendly I have ever met and nothing was done to help us after the cancelled our flight. To make matters worse our flight was cancelled awhile before we were ever notified. The costs we are incurring due to them is not worth any amount of saved money for a cheaper ticket and we now have 12 hours of flying to get from Cancun to Tucson not counting the several hours of layovers. Luckily our trip other than United was amazing but I would not get on another flight from this company even if it was half the price of its competitors. I cannot really come up with a good point from the company except price and its partners airlines. Breakdown of review categories: Value for money is lowest possible because I don't find any value in their service. The price was good for our flight if they met any expectation but failed in all categories. Ground and Air Service were both rude and I would have given the air service one star if it wasn't for the ground service being significantly worse comparably. Seat comfort was normal for an American airline company but still far behind all foreign flight companies I have flown with. Beverages and food options are a bare minimum. There was pretty much no inflight entertainment with a couple of movies (at least this was free because of the many mistakes and delays they had already caused but normally very overpriced and outdated.) I hate knowing that when I book with ANA (my favorite airline) I have a chance to be stuck with flights from this company and may switch my primary airline to avoid this. (Sorry ANA) This review is only regarding my recent flight. I had several negative experiences prior but the relationship with ANA and price kept United as an option until today.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to Phoenix with United Airlines. 7 hour delay. The plane has no phone charger and flight is 2+ hours. The plane offers personal device entertainment but there is no way to charge your phone, and no back of the seat screens. I'm a average size male and there is no leg room and very uncomfortable.\", \"united airlines Boarding for both sectors was done early and by groups. Air traffic control delays at Bogota meant a 25 minute delay arriving into Houston. This flight was operated with a Boeing 737-700 and was packed. Cabin crew were ok if not somewhat lackadaisical. Perhaps it was the midnight departure. Announcements were barely audible. For inflight entertainment, this plane was equipped with DirectTV rather than the airline's far superior wifi delivered personal device entertainment. This meant having to pay to view the only 8 movies available - as the rest of DirectTV's content library is inaccessible outside the continental USA. Big Fail. The cabin was uncomfortably warm throughout the flight and coupled with the older seats, tight pitch and full load made it far less pleasant and also difficult to catch any shut eye. Strangely, a full meal is served on this sector at about 1.30am, which to be honest, wasn't bad. Made me wonder why our outbound to Panama from Newark of a similar duration and more appropriate departure time for a meal service, offered no complimentary catering. The crew did a few water runs until arrival in Houston. Transfer at Houston took longer than I expected owing to slow immigration clearance. However, I boarded the next flight with ample time to settle in. This aircraft was a Boeing 737-900ER with the newer seats, sky interior and wifi delivered entertainment. What a difference. It just felt more spacious. Seats were a bit more comfortable and legroom seemed to be better. Perception is everything I guess. The crew this time were sunnier, cheerful and seemed pleased to be onboard. Pushback was right on time and arrival 18 minutes early. Service consisted of the usual morning beverages and a stroopwaffel. A second round of coffees and a couple of water runs were done as well. All with a smile. This last flight was clearly the best of 3 I took with United over the last 10 days. Pity both the shorter international sectors I experienced were not quite up to scratch and felt more like domestic runs. One thing I find United has excelled at is it's mobile app. In terms of accessible information, actual usability and integrated entertainment - I think it exceeds the capabilities of most other airlines.\", \"united airlines Newark to Panama City with United. We received a text from United as we arrived at Newark that the flight was delayed almost 3 hours due to late inbound aircraft as a result of weather and air traffic. I was concerned as it was clear now that we would not make our connection in Panama to Cartagena despite the 90 minute layover. Customer service at Newark reaffirmed the airline would not foot the bill for a hotel because of those reasons for delay. I had travel insurance so was not worried about that too much. Eventually took off and once onboard, crew were fine and reasonably friendly. They waived the DirectTV fee due to the delay. That was good except that once you're out of the Continental USA, your viewing selection is reduced to around 8 average movies you've probably already seen. No food except for a bag of pretzels, a couple of drinks and water runs for this 5 hour flight. New seats were fairly comfortable, sky interior, seat pitch was Ok, but cabin was hot for most of the flight. However, upon landing at Panama was very pleasantly surprised by the efficient ground staff who did in fact have hotel and meal vouchers, and our connecting flight for the next day, all ready and waiting. That was a huge plus. We did have to take our luggage out and recheck them the next morning for our onward trip on Copa.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Chicago. We were seated in the business class section of this plane, although the ground staff referred to our seats as first class. We were in seats 1A and 1B. The male flight attendant on this flight very obviously did not like his job - he never once smiled, never once said thank you, please, your welcome - it was if we were an inconvenience to this man. I have never in all my years of travel, encountered a more surly flight attendant. Once we arrive to Chicago (we were on route to Toronto) we deplaned the aircraft and went in search of a board to see what our next gate would be - none were immediately available to us and we walked quite a way in terminal 1. I asked a United ground staff person how we get to Toronto and showed her my ticket, and she proceeded to send us to Terminal 5 - which is outside the security area and at the far end of the airport. This required taking the train, walking a fair distance, and once we arrived the ground staff at the entrance to this terminal advised us we needed to return to Terminal 1! Needless to say, we were not happy. Our flight was scheduled to depart 1 hour after we arrived at this airport (Chicago) and when we finally cleared security (again) and made our way back, the flight was already boarded and our overhead bins were full. And we were flying in seat 2b and 2d (I may have the seat numbers incorrect, but you get the idea - we were again in Business class.) This flight was a treat - the flight attendants were very pleasant, and had to deal with my ranting about being sent all over the airport by United ground staff. The flight was uneventful, but much better than the LA to Chicago route. United needs to get their people trained properly. I will not be flying with this airline in future if I can help it.', 'united airlines Newark to West Palm Beach. With Mathew hitting Florida, West Palm Beach Thursday and Friday the resorts are closed and evacuated. We were told they hope to reopen early week if the damage is not severe, Our hotel is cancelled, (graciously). United refuses to accommodate us at all in terms of moving dates to next week or refunding. If we choose to travel by July 2017 they will gladly charge us a $200.00 up charge fee per passenger (on a $108.00 ticket!) to use. United is disgusting and I will never book anything with them again!', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Charleston to Denver. This would have been my first time flying United Airlines and it will never happen again. Hurricane Matthew is supposed to be hitting the charleston area on Friday night. My flight scheduled of course for first thing saturday morning. The entire city of Charleston is being evacuated. Highways are being reversed in the direction out of Charleston on Wednesday at 3pm. We are forced to leave and as a result, will not be in Charleston to catch this flight. As if being displaced wasnt bad enough, United\\'s \"policy\" will not allow me to change my departure city without paying the fare difference. Flying out of the same city early isn\\'t an option because were being evacuated. Flying after the storm means I miss my sisters wedding. Changing cities is now on me as if im not doing everything i can to make this flight. Unreal. No other airline has ever been this insensitive or unaccomodating.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Chicago. Check in was difficult because the staff was having trouble with another customer. Fortunately, I did not have any luggage to check, so the self check worked fine. Lunch was horrible. The roast beef sandwich was soggy and tasteless. I also did not receive a receipt and had to call three times to have a receipt for lunch emailed to me, not immediately, but within 10 to 14 business days. No receipt available on board. Not a problem, because in the future, I will not buy any food on UA.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Milan to San Jose via Newark. We get to Milano Malpensa to find out that our flight has been delayed 1 hour 40 min due to mechanical problems. The lady at the counter said that since we were arriving to Newark and probably missing our connection to San Jose, Costa Rica she gave us boarding passes for the flight we were \"Supposedly booked on\" , and for the flight the next morning, since the flight we were booked on was in the evening. So, after the 4.5 hours of delay we were finally called to board. The flight was good, and we hoped to find that the flight in the evening got delayed so we didn\\'t have to stay in an airport hotel and hop on the flight the next morning. So, we get to Newark and realize on the United app that our flight to SJO had taken off 2 min before we landed. We passed through security, which took 1 hour 20 min, we went to the counter and asked for a hotel room to spend the night and hop on the flight we had already been booked in for SJO the next morning. The whole flight was in there, trying to do the same as us, so we spent another 2 hrs shouting at the counter lady who didn\\'t want to give us a room. We argued until she did and we suffered a long line before. When we got to the hotel in a shuttle, we noticed this place was old and nasty.', 'united airlines We flew Chicago to San Francisco for my wife\\'s cardiac procedure. Since we wanted good seats, we booked early and got seats on the two-seat side very far up in Economy Plus. (That plane has a 2-5-2 configuration.) However, when we printed out our boarding pass the day before the flight, United had left my wife with the window seat but moved me about 25 yards back in the 5-seat section. We were shocked. There was no change of equipment, which might have explained it. No explanation, no apology. When we got to the airport, I said to the attendant at our gate that we chose our seats well in advance, so by rights those two seats together should be ours. She gave me a sly smile and said, in effect, \"No, you have no right to those seats. United retains the right to reassign seating for no reason or any reason, and that\\'s what we\\'ve done.\" Chalk it up to declining competition in the airline industry. With so few competitors, United feels they can treat their customers like pawns that they freely move around on the board at their whim. Last April we flew on United from Paris to Chicago non-stop. Once the doors were closed and the pilot taxiing to the runaway, the flight attendant said, in effect, \"You think we\\'re flying non-stop from Paris to Chicago. We\\'re not. We\\'re flying from Paris to Newark where this flight will end.\" The explanation: the pilot\\'s maximum flying hours expired when we got to Newark. We were delayed many hours at Newark before they lined up a plane for us to take to Chicago. Again, passengers are just pawns.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Columbus to Chennai via Washington. Worst experience with customer service. It took me 4 hours to finally get to an agent who took time to listen to my concern. I accidentally clicked on Cancel instead of Change and called them immediately to help me with the situation. But instead of helping me, they told straight that it will be additional $300 change fee (the previous consultant told me was $200 only). I was on call with them for 1.5 hours - out of which I talked for only 20 minutes hardly and they had be on hold for the rest of the time. Accidents like this happen, the airline could have helped me out, but that was not the case. I don't have an option to get out as I dont want to lose so much money which I already paid.\", 'united airlines Our overall experience traveling on United from Barcelona to Dulles was a positive one. The flight attendants tend to look very tired and worn out but pleasant. My one concern was leaving Barcelona. When I approached the service counter to check in, I gave the employee our confirmation number. He just sat there and stared at me. I asked, \"Did I give you the right information?\". He looked annoyed and asked for our passports. As we left the counter, I doubled checked my boarding passes and only had three. Mine was missing. There were four in our party. I returned to the counter and told the employee I only had three. He said, \"I printed four.\" Well, I only had three. He pulled up the info on the computer, went to click print and guess what? Only three came out again. And as before, my boarding pass was not one of them. If the printer, computer or staff member had made the mistake, they should up to it, instead of sternly telling that they had printed it. We went to our gate and waited for the boarding call. Never heard one. We noticed people lining up to board so we headed over. No one was sorted by loading zones so when we did board, there were passengers everywhere on the plane. United out of Barcelona was not the best experience and it seemed unorganized.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I fly only a couple of times per year. Over the last 5 to 10 years, that has been split between Southwest and United. That\\'s now tipping in favor of United. The big difference is boarding. On United, even if I board the plane last, the seat that I chose online is waiting for me. On both airlines the overhead bins are a problem. But, that is not the airlines, it is the inconsiderate passengers, who drag over-sized bags, or too many bags onto the plane. The cabin crew remains helpful and courteous. How long would you last dealing with what you see on airplanes these days? I left a Samsung tablet in the seat packet. I figured that was gone. But no, the clean-up crew found it, and they called my cell phone: \"We have your tablet\". That says a lot. I am flying United, whenever I can.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My daughter and I flew to Heathrow from Lexington and our first flight via Chicago went well. Plane departed and arrived on time. Unfortunately, the next leg of the trip wasn't as good. We sat in the plane in the heat for over an our before the plane departed. Once we were in the air, I took off my shoes and unfortunately slipped on the plastic runner under my seat and broke my toe on the seat in front of me. I mentioned it to the flight attendant who said I could have a wheelchair waiting for me at the gate in Heathrow - I declined as I felt I needed to at least try to walk, this was the beginning of my vacation with my daughter. The next thing that happened was that my special food order (gluten free) wasn't available. They said they never got the order although I had specially made the order on-line before my flight. I had to make do with another meal and the same with breakfast. The exact same thing happened on my return flight to the U.S. even though I'd made sure the order was done on-line once again. On the return flight, the flight attendant went to first class to get me some fruit and cheese. The plane was so old and tattered (both ways), the bathroom had ashtrays inside. The entertainment was non-existent with a tiny screen on the seat in from about the size of two decks of cards. All of the movies started at the same time so we were unable to choose anything that hadn't already started. Even if I'd been able to choose something, it would have been impossible to hear as the plane was so loud that my ears were buzzing long after the flight. Everything was old and tattered. What has made me even more irritated is that I received an email asking me to rate my journey (both ways). I mentioned these things and haven't heard a word from United. The reason I've given this review three stars instead of one is that three of our four flights were reasonably on-time with no lost luggage.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Honolulu to Memphis via Houston with United Airlines. The worst flight experience I\\'ve had in a long while. First, the charging plugs on my entire row was not working. All the flight attendants said was \"oh I\\'m sorry, I\\'ll write it up.\" I had to press the issue until I was given an alternative to getting my devices charged. The next thing was discovered when we landed in Houston, was that we was not going to make our connection to Memphis. So we was directed to customer service. We were given a later flight, but they failed to inform us that that flight was delayed as well. We found it out while on our way to our gate, by text message. They knew that that flight was delayed long before we got our flight rebooked. They allow flights to be booked too close together so there is no way the connection can be made. And they fail to inform people about delays until the last second. Then all they can say is \"I\\'m sorry\" So empty, so sad. Now if we do not comply with their rules and schedules, they can decline our flight, without refund. Now how is that fair? They can mess up in every way and nothing is done except to say \"I\\'m sorry.\" Not a happy camper - all my plans have been changed due to United Airlines messing up.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Service was fine and everything went as planned flying United Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth to Newark. Its a 3 hour flight and prior to boarding the gate agent reminded everyone to download the app before heading on board. Terminal has free wifi so it was slow to download but achievable, Once you have the app you could use the in-flight entertainment on your BYOD for free. There was movies and TV shows, limited choice but enough to fill the 3 hours in. Cabin crew were friendly with 2 drink services and one pre packet cookie. Like always flight was full and they asked for volunteers to check baggage first before stopping others. Gate agent was friendly and was given a exit row window seat. Nice bonus really. Baggage re claim was okay considering all the incoming flights.', 'united airlines Los Angeles to Newark with United Airlines. This has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had with an airline. My flight was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 2 hours (this is not that bad part), and I had to scramble to get a new ticket out to EWR. I was able to get an American Airlines flight out (through United customer service). For my return trip, somehow my ticket was cancelled and no one at United could help. I spent hours on the phone and all I got was \"sorry we cannot do anything to reissue the ticket, and you need to contact AA\". I spoke to about 5 separate people, who put me on hold for at least a half hour at a time. Finally I called AA, and they called United with me, to try to understand how it became an AA issue. All of a sudden, United figured out the problem (after another 45 minutes on hold with the AA staff).

They like to slow play the delays on you. One thing is that the App is very helpful keeping track of delays, cancellations and gate changes. Which is the only thing that is for sure. Boarded the plane and waited over an hour for pilots! No air con, no wash water in the toilets. Just the most poorly managed airline out there.

I was told by phone that I could purchase a couple of things that I needed for a maximum of $100 dollars until my luggage arrives and that I would be reimbursed once I sent them a receipt of what I purchased (along with a couple of forms). I went ahead and bought a swimming suit and a shirt. All together my total was $65. It's been a month later and they haven't got back to me! I called them over 5 times and have emailed them with all the forms they wanted 4 times. If you need to call their 1800 number don't even bother, they are unhelpful and inturrupt you before you finish your sentence. Also my luggage was 56 pounds on the way back and they charged me $168 dollars for it. I get home and check my statement online and I notice that they charged me $168 twice instead of once. Overall this has been a vacation from hell.

I have been flying United twice a week for business. United never seems to be proactive to check their carry on bags, so a group of people typically has to deboard the plane to go up and check their bags. Usually they have two extremes where they check everyone's or no ones. Let's standardize, United. During this flight, people asked to check their bag and the boarding lady denied them, causing a big back up. She seemed clueless and new without any help. When I got on the plane after I checked my bag, people were still trying to leave the plane to check their bag. The flight attendant yelled at me to slide into a seat when I got to my row and already asked my seat mates if I could get to my window seat. The flight attendant then gave me a dirty look-exactly how I wanted to start my morning. I just hope my return flight leaves on time, which is only on time 40% of the time (source: United.com).

The attendant in Monterey did an amazing job rerouting my flight and giving me back up options. However, when I got to SFO, it was a different story. The connecting flight did not make it in on time so I needed to reschedule yet again. The staff member at the customer service desk was incredibly unprofessional. They were telling jokes and speaking in a different language on their cell phone while they were with customers, and we're just downright inattentive. The customer service in SFO was terrible.

I knew most US based airlines were not good from several past experiences, but this time United went far below any expectations. Boarded a plane that the crew knew had a problem, and had to unboard after they could not fix the problem. - This because these planes look old, worn out and not appealling, or reassuing to fly. - Had no certaintiy whether flight would be canceled or not until 3 hours after initial take off time. Got rerouted and was not given option to take earlier connection which had a 1h40 mns transit time. Instead, I was given a connection time in Heathrow of 4.5 hours! Little details like your meal choice cannot be satisfied as they do not board enough meals to give people a real choice. When I complained about this to the hostess, I got a cold answer: \"How would we do business if we board more meals than passengers to give everyone in business class a choice?\". I answered her back: \"well, may be you should ask all the other airlines I fly how they do it: European, Asian, Middle Eastern\". I have a senator status with Star alliance, supposed to be a valued customer.

Cocktails and Wine were served in stem glasses,. Pillow was comfy but the duvet was just ok. The purser and flight attendant were on their game the entire flight. I flew in Business from Vancouver to Houston to connect to this flight. The flight to Houston was horrible. I was in 3A on an A320. No entertainment system or cabin screens.

We first waited 25 minutes outside in the dark to go through security due to the construction. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours. There were no seats at the gate since there were multiple United flights that were delayed. Later our gate was changed with no announcement from 74 to 72. When we asked an United employee at the first gate, she had no idea which gate was correct. It was finally determined gate 72 was the correct gate. When we went over to gate 72, there were no lights and they were completing construction with drilling, jack-hammering, and shouting right next to us. It was extremely loud, we were sitting in the dark, with no United employee in sight. Our flight, initially delayed to 1:15 am continued to get pushed back. When I went to use the restroom before our flight, the restrooms were disgusting. When an United employee finally came to our gate and I expressed my concern that not only were we severely delayed and sitting in the dark with an absurd noise level, but now there weren't even restroom facilities available, she told me there was nothing she could do and dismissed me. Due to United's delay, our arranged transportation home from the Newark airport had to be adjusted causing significant inconvenience. I could not believe the lack of communication, unsanitary conditions, disorganization, and the complete lack of professionalism we experienced from United. It was the worst experience and a complete disgrace at the end of our honeymoon.\", 'united airlines Flew from Tucson to Denver. After many miles with United, I have concluded that: 1) The company and most of the employees just don\\'t care about service. 2) They will cancel flights at the last minute when the planes are not full. 3) They have a lot of \"mechanical problems\", and the lie about the expected departure time to prevent you from making other arrangements. 4) Their attitude is \"take it or leave it\". I suggest you take the latter option when you can.', \"united airlines Oslo to Savannah via Newark. Flight was on time both leaving Oslo and arriving in Savannah, but both planes were dirty with trash left in seat pockets and dirty tray tables. Toilet didn't flush properly because it was so full. Food was very disappointing, and I am not a fussy eater. In Newark we waited almost an hour for our baggage to be delivered on the carousel, causing some passengers to miss their connecting flights. We barely made ours even though we had plenty of time. We re-checked our 3 bags for our short flight from EWR to SAV, but only 2 of the bags showed up in SAV. One was lost and delivered to us the day after we arrived. One of the bags that made it all the way was ripped in transit. I will avoid United flights in the future if possible.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Nashville to Houston. Literally every time I fly United it is the worst flight experience. Not only are their planes horribly outdated, but the staff and flight attendants are rude. I flying to be at a wedding this weekend and I'm horribly sick. I asked a flight attendant for help lifting my carry on bag and she rudely said if I couldn't lift it myself I'd have to go back and check it because lifting baggage isn't her job. I politely told her I'd take care of it. But seriously, where is the excellent customer service and just general kindness anymore?

Upon check-in, I was extremely surprised to see that my seat hasn't been assigned and it said 'see agent' instead. I spoke to one of the customer service representative who informed me that this is what happens when the flight is oversold and that they will assign me a seat at the gate. She also said that the only seats available are middle seats. It is the first time something like this happened to me and I was really shocked, especially when buying the ticket I requested for a window seat. Does that mean that request are then being ignored, the company oversells flights and does not care about their customers (while flying 11 hours)? Well, that's how it looks like.\", 'united airlines There are not enough exclamatory adjectives in the English language to describe how I feel about United Airlines. The airline - specifically its customer-facing operations - is simply terrible. My flight was from Moscow to New York on August 31st. On August 30th I get an automated email saying that my flight is scheduled as planned. I noticed that they had the wrong time of flight in the email. So, I went online and verified the correct flight time (a flight at the time they sent me didn\\'t exist). When I arrived at the airport and began the check-in process there was no record of me in the system. The kiosks gave me \"not found\" and the personnel at the counters confirmed the same. My flight was in two hours and I was starting to panic. I called United Airlines and got an agent. I explained my situation, told the agent that it was urgent and I was about to miss my flight, and asked if I could speak to a supervisor. The agent put me on a very long hold and then disconnected me. After a number of similar calls to the call center I finally got an agent - an hour later - that told me that somebody at UA had deleted my record from the system on the morning of my flight and I no longer had a seat on that plane. Really UA? Wow. Given the number of long holds, disconnects, and agents not able to correctly diagnose and resolve the problem from the start, I missed my flight. I had to take a later flight that day which made a mess of my plans. I will not use United Airlines again. It bends my mind that an airline could simply remove a paying customer from a confirmed flight without notification and leave him to sort out the mess at check-in. A mess that was met, not with any apologies or concern for my predicament, but with endless hold times, disconnects, and supervisors that are \"too busy at the moment\". With so many choices, why chose an airline clearly doesn\\'t give a damn about its customers? I certainly won\\'t.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Cincinnati. I have now flown with United three times, the first was delayed 4 hours. The second was cancelled, then had to wait for 5 hours for another plane that was apparently overbooked then flown out on a plane the next morning. Finally the fourth time, I am here sitting in the plane delayed 3 hours and sitting next to the gate. I have had horrible experiences with United, there will not be a fifth time. They cannot keep a schedule and do not offer anything in recompense. Do not fly United unless you do not value your time.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Chicago O'Hare. Terrible at keeping flights on time or listening to customers. I came four hours before my flight, I was going to work from the airport. When I arrived at the airport I received an email saying my flight was delayed, this delay was going to make catching my connecting flight very unlikely. I approached the counter and told the woman of my concerns, if there was a flight I could catch sooner, fly to a different hub, etc. she said I would be fine. My reply was that if the flight was delayed even 1 more minute I would miss my connection. 4 hours later were supposed to start boarding and I get a new notification saying my flight was delayed another hour. I was going to miss my connection. I approached the desk, there were now no more flights that could get me to my destination, none even in the same state as my destination! So I had to rebook for two days later. I wasted my PTO of two days, shortening my vacation, wasted money on cab fares to and from my house and back for my next flight, they don't reimburse and just frustration that they couldn't be proactive in the situation to find a solution. So here I am two days later, didn't get to choose my seat, I'm checking in and notice there are aisle seats further up than mine that are open and I ask the woman at the desk to please change my seat. She said to do that at the gate. By the time I got through security and up to the gate all those seats were gone. More frustration. One small change could have improved today but the lack of care and sense of urgency from the United team has made my respect for the company vanish. They don't care how you feel, they don't care about your time, your money, your enjoyment of their services. Somewhere along the way they must have forgotten it's their customers who make them.\", 'united airlines I purchased a ticket for my daughter from Oslo, Norway to Seattle, via London and San Francisco. Her United Airlines flight out of London was more than five hours delayed, which made her miss her flight in San Francisco. The plane from London to San Francisco was without any entertainment, on a flight that took more than ten hours. I joined her on our flight from Seattle to Oslo, via San Francisco and Frankfurt. The flight out of San Francisco was almost two hours late and they managed to arrive late in Frankfurt. We barely made our flight to Oslo, but our luggage did not. The worst part of the UA experience was the flight from San Francisco. There was no entertainment and the promised wi-fi did not work. Some of the flight attendants promised to help with the wi-fi, but never returned. Some of the flight attendants were nice, but some were also rude. In the future, I will go to the greatest lengths to avoid UA and will definitely warn others against using this airline.', 'united airlines Our flight was supposed to be leaving Washington DC at 8.15am. Once we boarded, the captain informed us we would have to get off because they were having some problems. First the re-boarding time was 9am, then it changed to 10.30am, then to 1pm. Upset, I went to the help desk to see if they could put me on a different flight or give me any information at all. The woman I spoke with was extremely rude and no help whatsoever.

Plane was full in First and Coach. Due to some issues with baggage flight was boarded but delayed by nearly 1 hour. Captain updated us frequently on the procedure which was very much appreciated. Crew over all very friendly and attentive. My expectations on food were low reading all the bad reviews about United - but I was positively surprised. We got salmon and this was absolutely fine.

UA added a $150 unaccompanied minor fee for my nearly 16 year old daughter and almost cancelled the flight on me. If you are going to charge this ridiculous fee, let your customers know up front they have to pay it. My 15 year old who has flown all over the world and has never been charged a fee but could not fly alone on a non-stop flight to SFO. You should not add a fee on after and threaten to cancel her flight.

The staff were rude at all encounters. Firstly, I was told the cabin was too full for my carry-on bag so I had to give it to a crew member to put it with the checked baggage. My connecting flight from Newark to Halifax was cancelled until the next day due to the weather. We stood in a line for an hour and half to talk to an incredibly rude staff member, who told us they would do nothing to help accommodate us for the night of expenses. They refused to return my checked luggage to me which I needed, and assured me it would be on my flight the next day. When we were on the flight the next day going to Halifax, we paid the fee to rent a movie, as United Airlines does not provide free movies like other airlines. We then found out that even if you pay you cannot start at the beginning of the movie, you start wherever the movie is at, as they run on a repeating cycle. Therefore we accidentally watched the last 5 minutes of the movie we paid to see. Also want to mention that of the four planes taken on this trip only one had a TV which was not free. Two of these flights were two hours long and two were five hours long. United Airlines also advertises free wifi on the plane, which doesn't work.

Since the merger with Continental I have never seen a company go so far downhill in its customer service. Having flown for a number of years on this route I can actually compare. I am shocked, disappointed and extremely angry by the customer service provided on the ground. Flights delayed (no shock there, we were at Newark) but the inability for ground staff to give any information. Then we come to the actual flight. When I see these advertisements on T.V I am beyond frustrated. We pay a huge chunk of money to fly transatlantic and get put on planes that are old. No space. and we then pay this huge amount of money to feel like sardines in a can. We are lucky to be treated like people, spoken to like idiots, and then have to watch a fantastic safety video (on a screen that probably doesn't work), which also cost millions to make.

We have never experienced such a bad quality of service. After boarding a plane and been ready to take off at 8:25 pm, we had the announcement informing us that we had to go back to the gate due to a computer problem in order for the technicians to fix it. After getting the OK from maintenance, the plane was pushed back, but it stopped a few moments later. After another 30 minutes waiting, we got the announcement from the cabin telling us that the plane had to go back to the terminal because of the same problem. Back at the gate we were told to disembark and take all our belongings because it would take at least a couple of hours to fix the problem. A few minutes later the crew starts leaving the plane and we asked why? The lady says: nobody told you yet? The plane is only leaving at 7:00 am because the crew already used the hours and the pilot can't fly the plane. Then the announcement comes from the counter, but they also tell us that there are no hotels in the area to take everybody, so we will have to stay in the terminal. What about food? A $10 voucher when a sandwich costs $9:99. The night was over. Let's board again and be on the way to Lisbon. We had to wait for another 2 hours, in the plane, for the paperwork from maintenance to clear the work that had been done overnight. We finally took off at 9:30 am, 12 hours later. Just out of curiosity: United claims to be one of the biggest airlines and doesn't have another plane and a crew on standby to respond to this kind of situations?

Boarding was surprisingly quick for such a large plane. The staff that greeted us were very polite and pointed us towards our seats. The plane did not have any monitors but was fittied with wifi.

There was no food offered on this flight but got the stroopwafel and drinks. I love the waffel so I didn't complain and asked for one more. We were also given a blanket which was nice because the plane did get a bit chilly as our flight was early morning. Once, we took off the flight was bump free and smooth as it got. I have been on many flights and have done this flight numerous times with many airlines. This flight had to be the smoothest I have been on. Overall the only thing I wish they had was actual food on the flight and working wifi but the latter cant be blamed on United.

Service was attentive, food (I ordered the delicious Japanese selection) was ample, well presented and tasty. There were plenty of choices of things to watch, many of them unusual and interesting. Although there was not a lot of attention between meal services, there were always staff walking around. Water was given out from time to time. In other words, a perfectly adequate experience, but not stellar by any standard. The 8-across configuration is so yesterday. There is virtually no privacy and the seats. though comfortable are not generously sized at all. United Business/First is just not up to the standards set by most non-American carriers.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My wife and I have just returned from a trip to the USA (Newark to Sydney via San Francisco) flying United Airlines business class. Weâ€™ve flown a lot over the years but have never experienced an airline service quite as bad as this one. After a long flight from Sydney we faced a 6-hour delay in San Francisco awaiting a connection to Chicago. At one point we boarded a plane and were preparing for take-off. The plane was actually waiting on the runway for the go ahead to fly. Astoundingly, we get a cabin announcement informing us that we were to be taken back to the terminal as the pilot had gone over his assigned â€˜flight hoursâ€™ and couldnâ€™t fly the plane. You couldnâ€™t make this stuff up. Confusion reigned for the next few hours while United staff gave conflicting information. Firstly, we were told to stay on the plane and wait for a replacement pilot. We were then told weâ€™d need to disembark. One said we'd definitely be flying that day while another said we might not as they might not be able to get a pilot. Eventually, a pilot did arrive and we did fly out that day. Unfortunately, the return leg didnâ€™t improve. We were scheduled to fly from Newark airport to San Fran where we would catch another flight to Sydney. As time was tight between when the flight from Newark was due to arrive and our connection from San Fran was due to depart, we decided to arrive at Newark airport early to see if we could change to an earlier flight. We were told by a rather surly United staff member that all earlier flights were fully booked. Strangely â€“ when I checked my baggage in, the check in screen told me that for $75.00 I could take an earlier flight. After passing security, we decided to go to the United lounge and ask service staff about any other options for taking an earlier flight. When staff saw the tight connection time between the two flights they were in disbelief. They told us that this was an illegal connection and we should not have been able to even book it. They then offered to put us on standby and as it happened, we were able to get an earlier flight. On arrival at San Fran, my wife noted that an email had been sent to her from her work. When we hadnâ€™t boarded our â€˜bookedâ€™ flight from Newark our flight from San Francisco to Sydney had been cancelled. Service staff confirmed this and notified that our booked seats had already been sold and we might not be able to get seats on the flight. We were eventually assigned new seats but we might as well have saved our money and gone economy. Passengers were walking through the cabin all night and we had to put up with a screaming baby and the stench of diaper changes. The service was woeful and Iâ€™ve had better in economy on other airlines. Our seats hadnâ€™t been cleaned properly - there was rubbish and the screen control device was so sticky and dirty my wife had to wipe it down herself. Finally, when we arrived in Sydney we went to the baggage claim. After waiting an hour for our baggage we decided to check where it might be. Surprise, our baggage was still in San Fran. This despite asking United staff numerous times that our luggage was on the flights and receiving their full assurances. The service person in Sydney noted it was a common occurrence with United. When we turned around there was a line of United customers with the same issue. I realise others have had far worse flight experience, but ours wasnâ€™t great. You come away with the feeling that the dollar is definitely a priority over the customer.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Another huge disappointment with United. I was traveling to Sao Paulo on August 13th. I understand weather related issues and the 1 hr delay but once again the communication with United is just terrible and donâ€™t get me started on the attitude from the United personnel. They kept us on the plane for more than 1 hour because they couldnâ€™t move the gate bridge and maintenance was working on it. After weather and Gate Bridge delays, we left 140 minutes late but the problem is that 40 minutes after takeoff, pilot announcement was extremely disconcerting. â€œLadies and Gentlemen, we have a problem because we are getting some warning signs and the Autopilot doesnâ€™t work so we will have to get back to the closest mayor airport but we will not declare any emergencyâ€\\x9d. Once again having problems, I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just me that I travel too much or just bad luck. Unfortunately I have had more and more issues with United and for once I realize status doesnâ€™t mean anything as some United representatives are rude and disrespectful and they canâ€™t resolve problems. I guess I didnâ€™t get any compensation because I decided to cancel my trip as I was only going to be in Brazil for 36 hrs after all of this issue. I had 3 customers by themselves in Brazil and this was really costly to the company but I guess United doesnâ€™t really care about it. If this was a onetime thing, from time to time, it would be fine, but its almost every international overseas flight a take (7-8 a year) and then, several domestics as well.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Houston to Ottawa via Newark. The previous reviews I can vouch for. This airline is uniformly dire and I question why Air NZ places its passengers on this carrier if not for Star Alliance. In same league as Air China, which is also Star Alliance. On the plus side, my bags made it from NZ to Ottawa. Now for the negatives: overbooked cramped flights (offered usd 400 and usd 150 on both flights to take later flight - no thanks). Service with a snarl. Thanks to unexplained delays at Newark, my trip became 26 hr ordeal rather than a 23 hr ordeal. Zero service on the late night flight to Ottawa (like I said, just glad my bags arrived). Star Alliance should enforce minimum quality standards amongst ifs members. Clearly there is a disconnect.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Baltimore to Los Angeles via Chicago. This was one of the worst travel experiences of my life. They overbooked the first flight by 19 people and even though I was in group 2 for boarding did not give me a seat number forcing me to be the last on the plane and making me check my bag due to there being no storage space. Once we arrived in Chicago we were out on a very old dated plane with torn seats. We they say for hours as they tried to out safety signs onto one of the doors. They for some reason did not have these signs and stickers in stock so they had to manufacture them. Completely unacceptable.

Having other negative experiences with United, I was generally satisfied with this trip. This was the cheapest option for my trip, and had the best connection times. On the way down to Honduras, there was no issues except that the personal in-flight entertainment wasn\\'t working for some of the flight down to Houston, which wasn\\'t a big deal because I brought myself plenty of things to do. Both the flights from Denver and Houston left on time, and the flight from Denver arrived a little early. Coming back wasn\\'t quite as smooth. I checked in online and printed boarding passes from the hotel\\'s computer rather than doing it at the airport. However, the airport staff in San Pedro Sula wanted the version printed from the airport (not United\\'s fault). What my biggest gripe is that once I get to the ticket counter, I am rudely told that since I already have a boarding pass, they can\\'t print me another one. Luckily, I was able to eventually get to the secure part of the airport. Then when I am trying to board, the ground service rejects the boarding pass which I printed off of the United website, and almost wouldn\\'t let me board. After a few minutes of verification, they finally let me board, but first give me a lecture about \"not having a boarding pass\". Overall, all the flights were fine. The cabin crew were all very friendly, and since I have the United App, I could access the personal entertainment, which had a good selection of movies. They offered drinks, and the service was done very quickly. The legroom was a little tight, but the seats themselves were comfortable and the airplane was clean. With the exception of ground service in San Pedro Sula, I was satisfied with the airline. I may consider using them in the future.', \"united airlines Took my sister on her very first flight to visit my brother in Maine. Booked a flight on United Airlines and expected this flight to be no different than all the many other flights I have taken, but never with United. It was not only the worst flight I have ever had, it was a total nightmare! We left Austin, TX on time no problem. Arrived at O'Hare and the was the last of what was supposed to be a positive experience for my sister. When we arrived we proceeded to our departing gate, C7.

By the time I reached the customer service area the line was snaked around and way down the hall way. I stood in line for 4 hours! When I get to the front I was then informed that our flight had been canceled and we would be on stand by for the next available flight to Maine. When I asked when that may be she rudely told me that it will not be tonight but tomorrow morning. When I asked her what we were supposed to do she gave me a voucher for a discount to a hotel, but we would have to be back at the airport by 4:30am to be on stand by. Why bother going to a hotel? We would only get about two hours of sleep if that. They didn't even offer blankets or pillows! When we finally were informed that we would be called for the next flight I found out that only one of us would be called. I told them that we were together and we will not be separated - that was not what I paid for! My sister was terrified that we would end up on separate flights! Acting like we were severely inconveniencing him he told us to take a seat and wait. We finally were called and boarded, but in separate seats. Needless to say, this was not a very good experience for my sister and I was beyond upset. When I called the next day to change return flights for a day later, again I was made to feel like I was being an inconvenience.

More annoying however, the 3-4 hr flights are without infotainment, except the one you pay via WIFI. Considering that UA dropped me and many others, on connecting flights that commence boarding 5-10 minutes before landing, it is obvious that you have no time whatsoever to charge devices - not if going from UA to UA flight. Besides the lack of USB or any other ports, they want you to download their own apps and software, and hopefully be sucked into an UA wifi spending spree. Food? What food?

Since I had made all travel arrangements I called United's customer service line to make the changes. They said it would cost $200 to change flights. I said that was no problem and they gave me a departure time and flight number. I got off the phone relieved that I was able to get a flight for him at the correct time. Some time later I realized that I had not been asked for any payment information. That couldn't be right so I called customer service back and spoke with an agent who assured me that the flight was confirmed and paid for. I repeated to her that I was supposed to be charged $200. She said somebody must've made a mistake and I got lucky. I was told I would receive confirmation by email. Over an hour passed and no email. Called customer service again. I was told that they didn't know why I didn't get the email and again assured me that everything was confirmed. Next morning we drove over an hour from Colorado Springs to the Denver airport. I dropped him off and went back to my hotel in Colorado Springs. About 4 hours later I got a call from my friend. There were no flights confirmed! No one had any idea what he was talking about or how that could possibly have happened.

It is as if deliberate to be slow. Eventually, a short rush and was through. Take off was punctual, staff was efficient, but aircraft a complete disappointment. 5 hrs of flight in two legs, no entertainment and no food - Welcome to the \\'new United,\\' where no expense is wasted. Makes no sense, and severely retrograde versus anything else in Europe.', \"united airlines Newark to Las Vegas via Los Angeles. My initial flight was supposed to leave EWR at 9am. We didn't leave the gate until 10:05am and we took off between 10:40 & 10:50am. The flight staff stated that the delay was due to a mechanical issue with the door. My connecting flight at LAX left on time which I missed because the layover was one hour and one minute long. My flight arrived to LAX at 12:54pm, 1 hour and 20 minutes late. United changed my flight to a Delta flight that was to depart at 3:22pm but is now departing at 6:30pm due to extreme heat conditions. I contacted United who kept me on hold for over 50 minutes and ultimately spoke to me for less than 3 before abruptly hanging up. The customer service representative refused to make any adjustments, offered no compensation, didn't apologize, and refused to acknowledge that the initial United flight delay because of mechanical issues led to me missing my connection and subsequently being stuck at LAX. His only suggestion, before hanging up, was that I speak to someone at the counter (I am no longer at the United airlines terminal, which he was aware of) and to go to their website to leave feedback about my feelings. I should have been in Las Vegas by 2pm, the latest, and now I'm hopeful that I will arrive by 8pm. I am missing my cirque du soleil show that was to start at 7:30pm.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to London Heathrow with United Airlines. A complete unprofessional airline provider that is not trustworthy. Waited more that 5 hours and they kept moving the departure time 1 hour at the time. Was supposed to leave LAX at 5.45pm. First delay was set to 10pm then 10.15pm then 11.15pm and they don't help at all. They give you a 10$ voucher and tell you to go buy a meal. There staff leave the counters and there is no crew or staff that can help you. A big failure to fly with them!\", 'united airlines Montego Bay, Jamaica to Huntsville, AL. Absolutely the worst flying experience to date. First flight delayed 2 hours due to mechanical issue, after switching our plane, the next plane was delayed 30 minutes for mechanical issues. Missed connecting flight in Chicago. Went to United Airlines Customer service desk, was told hotels were full, they couldn\\'t help us and \"good luck\" . Had to stay 45 mins out of city that night because no flights out to destination until 14 hours later. Ran up hotel bill, taxi, food bill and missed a day of work. United did get us on flight next day, but never any apologies. Horrible, non maintained aircraft.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Very good airline. Changed from Aer Lingus to United as my main Dublin to US airline because of a couple of mess ups in my seats the last few times travelling with them. This trip was the first time me flying business with United. Had no issues very well treated on the flight, had lie-down beds so I slept for 4 hours of the 7-hour flight the other 3 hours were usually having a lovely 5-course meal provided. The amenities in business were fantastic too. Boarding was very quick it was not a hugely busy flight business class had about 9/16 seats taken. The only thing I dislike is they did not offer free wifi to their business customers! Overall they're my new favourite airline to fly with.\", 'united airlines Flew from Indianapolis - Chicago as a codeshare of Air Canada. Since this is a short flight, there is nothing much to be said. The flight was very punctual. There was neither beverages nor food on board. Although the airplane was said to provide free entertainment through its wifi network, I did not try it because I did not download the United App.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United from Shreveport to Orange County via Houston. Flight from SHV to IAH on ERJ-135 was overbooked. They asked for a volunteer to give up seat. First offer was for $500, but no one took it. When United raised the offer to $600, I volunteered to give up my seat. After a few minutes of processing my request, United told me that I wouldn't have to give up my seat, but they upgraded me to Premium Economy for my next segment on Airbus 319 from Houston to Orange County. The extra leg room in Premium Economy was a welcome addition to my journey. Unfortunately, one of the bathrooms in A319 wasn't working, so Premium Economy passengers were allowed to use the bathroom for 1st class passengers.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines round-trip between Orange County - San Francisco during 4th of July weekend. Flight from Orange County was delayed, but the automated text messages by United on my phone kept me updated. Boarding on ERJ-175 was done from a gate that did not use the Jet Bridge. The jet-engine noise inside ERJ-175 cabin was significantly louder than what I am used to on other domestic flights, but thankfully, it was a short one hour flight. Since I was seated in the rear of the aircraft, the plane had started its descent by the time beverage service came around.', \"united airlines San Francisco to Monterey with United. Of the 6 legs on a round trip flight, 5 were more than 2 hours late, crews and airport personel were rude and uncaring, this last flight from SFO to MRY was delayed 3 times and then cancelled at 1am leaving us stranded in SFO. The customer service reps said the most they could do was see if they could get some blankets for everyone, no refunds, no bus to get us home, no vouchers, nothing, most people ended up renting cars and driving to the destination. The explanation was 'weather', they gave this standing in front of a Doppler radar map showing no clouds or weather anywhere in the west and the plane was supposed to be coming from Burbank. People in line checked weather apps for Burbank, SFO and Monterey, it was clear and beautiful in all those places and everywhere in between. They use weather as the excuse so they don't have to refund the tickets because it's beyond their control. United employees are so rude it's obvious that they are unhappy and tired of lying to passengers. Staff onboard stood chatting in the galley and are rude to passengers, no please, thank you, etc. Won't take this airline again.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I have flown United Airlines several times, and they have shown incredible consistency in being the absolutely worst airline. My negative experiences with the airline date back to 2007. As for the present trip under review from New York LaGuardia to Chicago, here are the most relevant issues. First, the flight was delayed leaving the airport by over two hours. There was no explanation given for what led to the delay while we waited at the gate. Second, the space between seats is simply unfairly small. I am a 5\\' 10\" man who is not at all overweight. And yet, my knees were pressed firmly against the seat in front of me, and the space was so small that I could not open my laptop computer to do work on the flight (my laptop is a MacBook Air, the thinnest model). Third, once in Chicago airspace we were told we could not land and circled the airport for close to an hour. When it finally appeared that we were going to land, the landing was aborted at the very last moment and were re-routed to Detroit. The problem: no information was given that we were heading there, just a little surprise when we arrived at a different airport. Upon exiting the plane, there were no gate agents there to help with booking connecting flights, only the personnel who dealt with lost luggage. I could actually say more negative things about this flight but am limited by space. Suffice it to say that I will absolutely never fly United again unless they are literally the only option in getting to my destination city. I would happily pay double to avoid getting on a United flight.', \"united airlines I have been flying United Airlines very often from MBS (Saginaw) to ORD and back. Recently since a new company took over the previous ground handling it has been terrible. I have only flown 3 times in the past 3 weeks. The agents at the counter don't help with much at all. The ground handling is very slow. At a small airport like MBS with 3 united flights a day, you should not have to wait for ramp staff to come outside and meet the plane. The previous company AirWis had some of the greatest agents I have ever met and were always very respectful and good at their jobs. The new people need some more workers working a flight at a time so they can turn one on time also.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Having flown on many different airlines whilst travelling over the years, my family and I decided to opt for a little more comfort while taking an overnight flight from Sacramento to Newark via O'Hare. It turned out that economy plus on United Airlines is a scam to make you pay more money for very little else. We ended up having to pay for checking in bags, the seats were uncomfortable and the added 'leg room' was laughable. I had some box under the seat in front of me that meant i had to move my feet to the left for the flight, very uncomfortable. Staff on the flight were not interested in the economy plus / economy cattle behind the curtain and I was told a flat no when i asked if they had a spare blanket for my son who was freezing. I would never fly United Airlines again, save your money and book another airline that have genuine perks and benefits for your money.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I have flown United once before and swore never again, however I had heard they had improved so gave them another go flying from Newark to Birmingham, UK. I was pleasantly surprised the check in staff were helpful and we just sailed through. Yes we were delayed but what could United do about a thunderstorm. Communication about gate changes and the delay could have been much better, but once we boarded the plane the staff were fantastic. The only thing that let down the whole experience was the food at Newark International Airport. It is disgusting and this is from someone who will eat anything and not complain. We had heard it was bad but did not believe it, believe everything you hear and eat before you arrive. The only saving grace is that there is a Starbucks, which is about the worst I have been to all over the world, but better than anything else we found in the six hours we spent at this airport.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew with United from Denver to Kansai via San Francisco, or at least that was the plan. Before I start, I should mention that I am still a minor, with limited cash on hand and no credit card. I was and still am a relatively high-ranking frequent flyer member with Star Alliance, and this trip was bought with those miles. Straight off the bat my flight was delayed by 2 hours in Denver. There was no explanation as to why it was delayed, but I was directed to the customer service at Denver. There, I was told that I would miss my initial connecting flight that was supposed to take me directly to Kansai, but I could still take my delayed flight out of Denver to catch a flight from SFO to HND, where they would then put me on a flight from HND to KIX. That wasn't ideal, but was better than nothing so I took the offer and left Denver. When I arrived at SFO I was now told that I could not take the flight to HND, because the plane was flown by ANA, not UA. All they tell me is that there is nothing they can do. In the end, their alternative is for me to fly out on a 7:45pm flight from SFO, and then to fly out from HND to KIX at 8am next day. In total they made me wait 7 hrs in SFO and 10hrs in HND. I asked them to book a hotel at HND to spend the night, and all they would tell me is that I should do that at the UA counter in HND, but surprise, surprise the counter at HND was closed as HND is not a 24hr airport and I landed at 10:35pm local time. I ended up having to walk and take buses around HND at midnight. Calling hotels while carrying 4 bags for 2 hours trying to find a hotel that was open. I barley had enough money to pay for the night, and UA wouldn't reimburse me because â€œI went and booked it myself, not through UA.â€\\x9d If this had been someone that didn't speak Japanese, this probably would have been a far worse experience for them.\", \"united airlines Washington Dulles to Mexico City. We have a round trip from and to DC - the first flight was in economy class, it's the worst economy class I have ever been to, the seats are super super small! I'm 5 ft 9 and my knees were touching the front seat! The second flight was in economy plus and I recommend you flying in this class more than other. It has good leg room and comfy seats. The United ground staff at Dulles are rude, one staff member in the check in area started shouting to us to move. Good thing that the flight attendants were very sweet and cordial. The worst of all is that our plane was supposed to depart at 5:15 we depart at 7:30 - 2 hours of delay!\", 'united airlines Originally supposed to fly Spirit. Flight cancelled and they will not get me on another one to Houston for two days. I must get home to take care of my 90 year old mother. After cancellation at 9.30 pm, I went to United window and a wonderful lady at the counter was so helpful. The bottom line is I was able to get home, leaving that night. The staff member went to the gate to make sure things went smoothly since there was a lot involved in her getting this to work - the crew on the incoming flight had to approve going onward if we were to leave Minneapolis.', \"united airlines Flew Denver to Detroit. Numbers don't go low enough to rate my review of my experience with United Airlines. My family was scheduled to depart at 11.10am - 5hrs later, two planes taken out of service.

If anything can be learned by this experience - don't fly United.\", \"united airlines Cartagena to Edmonton via Houston.

Very disappointing customer service at the gate and check in. Flights are delayed both ways. You get tiny nuts packet and the staff will not even give one more packet when asked for.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines, first class from Los Angeles - Chicago and return. Service was appalling, other than the wider seat, it may as well have been a coach trip. Shortly after take off, I asked one of the flight attendants for a second serving of nuts, to my shock, she said (actually \"snipped\" was more like it) \"no, we have only one serving per person\". For a first class ticket, you can\\'t get a second thimble of nuts? When lunch was served, it seemed like it took forever, two or three passengers were served after which there were long intervals before the next few passengers were served. There were those who were finishing before we\\'d even started. As to the preparation - there was not even an attempt to cover the fold up trays with a linen of any kind and the food was not good - unappetizing coach grade cafeteria fare. Internet in both directions was available for a charge - something like $3.99/hour. This, I\\'ve never heard of especially in first class. Nonetheless, I paid for the entire flight and could not get it to work in either direction. $20.00 wasted. The condition of the plane felt ok, solid and relatively new - though the electric plug at my seat was loose, and wouldn\\'t hold a cord, the entire socket tipped out with the weight of the electric cord so that was unusable as well. The only redeeming value on the flight were the more comfortable seatings and the fact that the pilot seemed experienced. My question on this flight: other than the more comfortable seats - what did I pay for? This was a very poor excuse for what was supposed to be a first class flight.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington DC to Chicago O\\'Hare with United. From the employee who checked our bag before entering security in IAD to the final woman who said \"see ya\" in a demeaning tone as we exited the plane in ORD, I have never had more rude customer service through an entire trip in my life. Will never book with them again.', 'united airlines Flew United Airlines from London Heathrow to Newark, USA. Flight was early and took off early which was great. Lots of room as flight half empty. Cabin staff came round with drinks x 2 quite quickly into flight, then not seen again. Seen sitting at back of plane chatting on trips to toilet. On boarding plane I banged my face on window in between walkway and plane. Large egg came up on my eye. I reported it to cabin crew who were not interested in my discomfort. Staff looked smart in appearance but was not impressed with attitude. Entertainment good enough. Food below average, could have gone without.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to London with United. Worst lounge and worst food in Business Class that I have ever had. The company I work for always selects the cheapest business class flight from LHR to SFO and so I have tried quite a few - BA, Virgin etc. Apart from the seat that goes flat, United should be embarrassed to call this Business Class. I even had to pay for a Gin and Tonic in the \"Club\" Lounge, which was more full and far dirtier than the main airport. Never again. My team makes 200+ flights to SFO a year and I\\'m not going to let them go on United.', \"united airlines Quick and easy check in procedure at Geneva Airport. United boards from the C-pier via busses to the apron (our 767 and the IAD plane, were parked at the opposite end of the terminal, as there is construction here to build a new international long haul pier). Flight was maybe 25% full so a real treat to board an empty plane. United has done a nice job of updating these 767's that sports the 2 class cabin. It was clean and tidy, if standard United look and feel. Cabin crew were very pleasant on this empty flight. Departure was right on time. Good selection of films to pass the 8 hour + journey. Smooth flight. Flight deck kept us informed of progress. Food was very basic and not much of it. Mid flight ice cream and a pre-landing hot sandwich. WIFI did not work at all. Immigration, baggage claim, and onto Manhattan in 20 minutes after deplaning. Would have preferred the later Swiss flight to JFK on the A330-300 but this was a great alternative not just because it was empty, but because it was on time and early departure. United still have a long way to up their game but progress is slowly showing.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | San Diego to Maui and I will never use United Airlines again.

This airline is all about lining their pockets and no care for customers.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Paris CDG with United. Business class seats that are well behind competitors. 8 abreast, 4 in centre and required to step over to exit to WC. Narrow, cramped and minimal privacy. These are \"economy premium\" seats, nothing more. I would never choose UA again voluntarily for transatlantic flights. Ground staff were excellent: I had an involuntary re-rerouting and the assistance was great. Shame the commercial guys believe 8 abreast gives better economics than competitors six abreast. It won\\'t. Occupancy will be lower.', 'united airlines I\\'ll say first that the flight itself from Seattle to Newark was very pleasant. Both the outgoing and returning aircraft were newer, departed on time and arrived early in each instance. My review is going to focus solely on the support staff in the terminal, prior to security screening. My family arrived at Seatac airport roughly an hour and a half prior to our 6.19am flight. We checked our first bag, then attempted to check a car seat at the United Airlines terminal. It took them damned near a half hour to check a single car seat. What would have been ample time to make a flight had been cut by a third to do something that should have taken 5 minutes. Now for Newark. Same issue with checking the car seat, except the customer service specialist that walks up and down the check-in area, who\\'s job it is to assist customers with their trouble checking in and checking bags, practically ignored me until I had said \"Ma\\'m\" about 5 or 6 times. At which point she gave me a \"Why are you bothering me\" look and continued walking. If at all possible I will not be flying United Airlines again, especially not if I have anything more complicated than a boarding pass and a carry-on bag to deal with. Clearly that is more than they are equipped to handle.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Las Vegas to Houston with United Airlines. By far the most awful experience I have ever had! We were delayed due to sever weather and I know that was not controllable but we had a 4 hour layover in Houston and would have made it if the pilot and the crew didn\\'t time out and they would have had a crew to take us, which by the way the crew would have times out in the air during the flight. We get to Houston and they have no outgoing flights at night so we have no way to leave until 8:45 am the next morning but they won\\'t put us up for a night because according to them it isn\\'t \"their problem, they cannot control the weather!\" We spent the night in an airport that was locked down, no food or restaurant open except for some sandwich shop and we hadn\\'t ate since 9 this morning because we should have been home hours ago. Horrible customer service! The lady at our gate called for back up to help at least five times and not one person came. The only nice thing we had happen was the night janitor got us some blankets because it was freezing in the airport and we had 9 hours to wait for our next flight. I will never take this airline again!', \"united airlines WaShington to Honolulu via San Francisco with United. Crew to SFO not so friendly. Not bad, just not friendly or welcoming. San Franisco airport boarding was late and there were no seats in the waiting area, so it set up a chaotic atmosphere. The flight was totally full and I had to check my carry on, even though it fit in the size checker. Annoying, since I did not have any other checked bags, and it was not an issue on any of the other flights. Won't book with United again as the airline lacked customer service.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My United Airlines flight departed CVG on time. However, upon arrival in Chicago I began receiving emails (I believe it was 5 in total) each one pushing my flight back later and later. There was no gate agent or anyone to assist me. In fact the pilot showed up and was as baffled as the passengers. I was supposed to land in Norfolk around 2122 hrs but did not land until after midnight. As a result the rental car company and I was forced to rent a car from another company. To add insult to injury the luggage was delayed coming off the plane. There was no one else at the airport so why the luggage would be delayed on top of the everything else is beyond me. Luggage and additional car rental fees aside, the delay impacted the amount of time I could spend with my family. The return trip was no better. I was delayed out of Norfolk with no communication letting me know of the delay. I was also delayed in Newark New Jersey. They had a plane with no crew. I was supposed to be back in Cincinnati by 1555 hrs. on Friday June 24. In actuality, I did not get back until 1940 hrs. To add injury to insult my luggage was on a separate flight which did not land until 2040 hrs. As a United Mileage Plus Explorer card holder and a member of their frequent flier program, I am extremely disappointed in the lack of service, communication or concern. I will be cancelling my membership and credit card and taking my business elsewhere.', \"united airlines Flew from Los Angeles to Honolulu on a Boeing 777-200 with United Airlines. Check-in was quick and smooth and boarded on time. The plane was quite old with no personal TV screens, but had wifi which was at times slow and you could use the United app on your phone to watch their selection of movies and TV shows. The seats were surprisingly comfortable. Crew were Honolulu based and seemed fine but they could've been better. The only complementary beverages on this morning flight was a caramel-filled waffle, cookies and drinks, everything else you have to pay for so make sure you eat at the terminal or lounge before the flight. Felt more like a budget airline. Plane was completely full as the flight continued to Guam. Overall, the flight was alright but could've been better. Next time, I'll probably choose the 737 or 757 flight later in the day.\", 'united airlines Shanghai to Chicago with United Airlines. An appalling flight and very cold. Passengers were dressed for tropics of Shanghai (June) and shivered for 14 hours in considerable discomfort. Pleasant flight attendants far more interested in socilaizing with each other, could do nothing. Food was even worse than usual.', \"united airlines You'd think it would be so simple flying from Tampa to NYC, both being on the same coast, but United Airlines complicated it to a whole new level. Let me put it this way: I would have gotten to NYC sooner if I drove the whole way. I was only supposed to be traveling for about 6 hours during the day, but this trip with United required an entire day of traveling. I left Tampa around noon, and didn't get in to NYC until 2 in the morning the next day. On top of that, they managed to lose my luggage, and they still haven't found it after a day. My flight was continuously delayed until eventually they randomly decided to cancel it. I had to wait in the customer service line for well over an hour, and the representatives I tried calling were so unhelpful - it turned out there was actually an open seat on an alternate flight with a different airline leaving at an earlier time, but they didn't realize this until too late and ended up re-booking me for a red-eye flight flying out of a different airport. So I had to spend $30 for a shuttle ride to the different airport which took well over an hour. Once I got there, even the new red-eye flight got delayed by over 2 hours.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My return journey with United Airlines from San Francisco to Frankfurt of about 11 hours was unbearable.

I fly over 150 segments a year with United. My complaint is not with the crew or flight attendants. They do a great job despite the problems. United continually has flights that are delayed and cancelled. And because all of their flights are booked to 100%, the delays cause serious problems getting to your destination. Many of these delays are mechanical or personnel in nature (awaiting pilot or crew). Obviously, when you are so heavily invested with an airline, they've got you. It is hard to give up the status earned over the years. But if I knew then what I know now, I would have invested in a different airline. Hopefully, you wont make a similar mistake.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United has been horrible with delays and lack of information to customers. When it was Continental it was more predictable and better overal service. I have traveled back and forth from Italy and on each time delays for multiple hours with lack of information.

It had damage to door but the took pictures and waiting for authorization from headquaters. Its almost 1pm and we are still waiting. No work on plane. Just crazy and lack of concern for their customers. United crew has told me no problem with plane. Now they just announced 2pm maybe. They had hours to adjust or change flights. This is the third trip they have done this. Don't fly them.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I am so sorry to report what a big, and I mean big disappointment this was flying First Class with United Airlines from Kalamazoo, Michigan to Oahu via San Francisco. We paid an additional $2500.00 for these seats and only once did we go left rather than right. Only once did we actually have a place to put our feet, only once did we not have to sit and watch 200 plus people board and crash into our seats, and only once did we have television screen to watch a movie. Also not even a pre-loaded movie device was provided on our way home from San Francisco to Chicago. Also on that flight, even though we had the first two seats on the plane, when breakfast was served, I received oatmeal instead of the omelette that I had requested. For the premium price we paid, this was not at all what I was expecting. So very disappointed in United Airlines.', \"united airlines UA6 (Narita - Houston, 772 / Boeing 777-200) and UA1461 (Houston - San Salvador, 738 / Boeing 737-800) on 12 Jun 2016. Having read many negative reviews and horror stories of United Airlines, I went in with lowered expectations. The flights overall turned out okay, even though it was eventful and I did encounter problems like flight diversion and flight and baggage delays. First, UA6. The personal screen on the 772 was touchscreen and not very big. The touchscreen was not sensitive, and the system was not very user-friendly. That said, they have a decent repertoire of entertainment, even though they may not always be the latest (e.g. movies). The food turned out better than I expected, but this assumes you made the right choices (on my return flight, to be separately reviewed, I made the wrong choices). First meal (dinner) was chicken with rice, second meal (breakfast) was chicken and egg with rice, Japanese style. Both were actually good. Ice cream (vanilla) was served after the first meal, and in between the 12-hour flight they served drinks and also a burger. However, only the salad was horrible - edamame beans should not be served as a salad. Service was decent too - remember, if you are nice to the flight attendant (e.g. you are polite to them), they will also be nice to you. Seat was reasonably comfortable too. Unfortunately for this flight, bad weather at Houston caused us to divert to Austin, where we waited on the tarmac to refuel, and some snacks were distributed while waiting. This caused us to land at Houston eventually 3 hours late - and we thought we missed our connecting flight. Next, UA1461. We thought we would miss this flight, which was due to depart almost 3 hours after UA6 was supposed to land (If it was on time) at Houston. However this flight was also delayed, so we managed to rush on despite arriving late and being caught in security checks and waiting for baggage which did not arrive on the belt. Not the airline's fault, but do check with Houston airport staff if your baggage needs to be collected at the luggage belt at Houston to be re-checked, because ours didn't need to be but we did not know. This flight was on a newer 738, but no in-flight entertainment. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a pasta, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). Flight was delayed presumably by bad weather at Houston, but also because they were slow with loading the luggage (I could see from my window they were still loading the luggage even past the departure time). In the end, unfortunately my luggage did not make it from my delayed UA6 to my delayed UA1461, and I had to proceed to their airport staff at San Salvador airport to lodge a case. I have to give them credit for being rather efficient in locating my luggage, putting it on the next flight that night, and delivering it to me the next day by noon - this whole process could have gone much worse, so I am glad it was well-handled. Overall, UA did not turn out as bad as I had expected it to be for my first time, even though I did experience my first diversion and delayed luggage, despite having flown regularly for many years with other airlines.\", 'united airlines UA1541 (Tegucigalpa - Houston, 737 / Boeing 737-700), UA1699 (Houston - San Francisco, 789 / Boeing 787-900), and UA1 (San Francisco - Singapore, 789) on 17 Jun 2016. First, UA1541. Surprised to see that there was a personal screen, but it was with DirecTV and pre-recorded movies, and not available free of charge. However, in the end movies were made available free of charge, presumably due to slight delays on the ground at the start of the flight. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a wrap, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). I had wanted the sandwich but it was out of stock. Next, UA1699. In-flight entertainment was miles ahead since it was newer, though I notice the selection was less compared to my next sector which was a 16-hour international flight. Food was available for purchase, though the usual snacks and drinks were available free-of-charge. I did not buy anything, and survived on a zesty snack pack with Sprite. My seat was supposed to be window seat, but the window was misaligned so I had to lean forward to gaze outside. It was great to have no one sitting next to me in the middle, which enhanced the amount of space available considering that the Dreamliner in 3-3-3 seating is known to be rather cramped. Finally, UA1, newly launched earlier this month. I had expected it to be very painful to fly 16 hours on a cramped 787. It turned out to be uncomfortable but still bearable. Managed to get some light sleep, managed to be sufficiently entertained too. What failed me was the food. The first meal (dinner), I made the wrong choice and had a (vegetarian, but you dont know until you get it) pasta with just spinach, cheese and tomato sauce. Salad was as usual horrible. Luckily the ice-cream saved the day. In between I missed the turkey ham roll as I was asleep, but it was available at the back of the plane for self-service. That was helpful to stave off hunger pangs. The second meal (breakfast) was literally the worst in-flight meal I ever had. I did not have a choice as they had run out of the eggs, so there was only a (vegetarian again) noodle in some funky weird black sauce, with weird tasting mushroom, edamame (horrible again) and red pepper. Absolute disaster, so bad that my neighbour and I did not finish the food. Without the bun and butter I would have starved. Seat comfort-wise, legroom and width was okay though my friend who was a bit bigger sized and seated at the aisle could feel a significant narrower seat width compared to the other flights - his shoulders were up against the neighbour in the middle seat. Overall, service and food on board seemed to be not as good as my outbound flights from NRT to SAL via IAH, though the in-flight entertainment was better on the newer Dreamliner.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Rolled off the pad at Heathrow quicker than expected, touched down at Newark about 45mins early. We like! So not having flown with United Airlines for a while but flown quite a few others, I was a bit let down with the entertainment system. Tiny screen about the area of a large cellphone but without the picture quality. So the announcement comes when I'm sat down that you can use their app to stream it from airplane wi-fi to your tablet. Excellent, my tablet has a great screen, I just have to download a 60mb app before we take off. 4G drops and it chugs along but I get the app before we take off. The app works fine but United, please, if you offer wifi streaming because you scrimped on the seatback screens it's tight-arsed in the extreme to not offer any method of charging the damn device like a USB port.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | My experiences with United has been the worst out of all my travel experiences. My flight was delayed out of Houston, they put me on another flight in order to catch my connecting flight, that got delayed 4 more times, they put me on yet another one, I got into Newark, where I was suppose to connect to Buffalo. I missed that flight. The next flight gets in at 2am. So I opted to just fly home and forgo my trip. It was a hell of a day. To top it off, my parents were stranded in Japan overnight when they flew with United. My whole in-law family got stranded in Italy for overnight this past summer with United. There seems to be a very sad consistent theme here. I will try all I can to avoid United from now on.', 'united airlines My fiancÃ© and I purchased tickets on United Airlines thinking there would be no problems, but there have been nothing but them since we boarded. Our flight to Maui was delayed for over 2 hours due to mechanical errors. We ended up waiting on the tarmac for that time without even an overhead announcement, a great way to start a vacation. On our way back to Portland we are being delayed again due to mechanical issues and our barely booked flight has now turned into fully booked due to combining another flight going to portland due to mechanical issues. Sounds like United needs to pull themselves together. I am not a happy customer and will never fly with this company again.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | When I booked this flight I thought I was getting a deal. This flight was booked in Dec 2015 for a departure date of 20 May from Milwaukee to Honolulu. The seats I initially selected were not provided even though I paid the bill. What a mess and a headache going on for 3 hours getting this cleared up. I did not like the method for the WiFi connection. I had to pay an additional charge just to receive a video and still no Internet connection. The use of my own device and no way to maintain power. When I purchased food it was awful. I have traveled to Hawaii and back 6 times. This was the worst. Never will I utilize United Airlines again. At one time it may have been good, not anymore.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Houston to Pensacola with United. The lack of punctuality is very disappointing for a multi-billion dollar company. Communication is essential in today\\'s thriving consumer market which United Airlines fails to display on the event of delays. As a \"valued\" member of other airline companies, my first trip with UA is very disappointing. I am very dissatisfied and will not recommend this poor airline service to any of my colleagues or family members.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Quite simply the worst in cabin service in the industry. Catering - meagre, mean, and distributed across the flight in a way that makes no sense and leaves you wondering who from United has actually been involved in this experience. 14.5 hour flight from Melbourne to Orlando via Los Angeles - 1st service less than an hour into the flight - a tiny main meal at 10.30 am in the morning. Eat it because you will be waiting another 12/13 hours before you will see any more food, and when that finally comes - look at what is delivered - a bread roll and an egg frittata. I thought I would distract myself with movies and TV but no, the entertainment system was not working - so was hungry and bored for 8 hours. The actual aircraft was nearly brand new and was terrific - a pity the only variables that United have to differentiate themselves with are all to the negative.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | After missing one flight to reach our final destination, United Airlines connected us to London (out of course), to reconnect again to Athens. The rep at United Airlines who booked our tickets to London said she also booked our tickets for Athens. Upon arriving in London, Aegean had no tickets for us to leave for Athens with the 12.15 (we had arrived in London at 11.30), they then put us on the 4.30 flight. Finally, we make it to our final destination at 12.30am, over 12 hours later because of United Airlines. Now we have no luggage and everyone is putting the fault on each other. United is not taking any responsibility for my luggage when the last time I saw my luggage was when I handed it over to United.', 'united airlines Washington to Denver. My fiance and myself were late to boarding because the parking lot driver told us he was going to the correct terminal and did not so, we were late to board. An extremely nice United Airlines employee helped us switch our flight and we only had to wait an hour! Extremely thankful for her help!', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines flight delayed over two hours into Chicago. Missed flight into Dublin by 1/2 hr. When we got off the plane the wait for customer service was about 3 hours so any hope for a rebooking the same night was hopeless. When we finally got customer service they said the earliest flight they could accommodate was Sunday arriving Monday (it was Wednesday). Our total time in Dublin was only 4.5 days. After much persistence they booked us through Delta for us to arrive on Friday. Because of their delay we lost a day of our trip and had to pay for a hotel in Chicago. Now the real fun begins when we tried to address our luggage. The luggage department said they made arrangements for our bags to be transferred to Delta. Delta didn't have them when we went to check in. They called United who said they put them on our connecting flight that we missed. 4 days and 6 phone calls later I was told our luggage was in Dublin if we wanted to pick it up. We saved for a dream vacation and paid for a nightmare.\", \"united airlines Fresno to Pittsburgh via Denver with United Airlines. I am so tired of delays on United. 2 weeks ago I was delayed out of Fresno and missed my connection to Frankfurt, causing me to lose a whole day off my trip to Africa. Today, yet another delay, again out of Fresno, making me 8 hours late to my final destination. In the last few years I have spent 2 unplanned nights in Denver, been reduced to tears of frustration on 2 other occasions, and have been late by more than 3 hours many times. With airline profits soaring, you would think that they wouldn't be cutting resources so closely that I can pretty much assume I will be delayed on most of my itineraries.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Taipei to San Francisco with United - absurd and filthy are what come to mind each time I step onto a United flight. The flight attendants are rude and completely inattentive. The food is mediocre and I'm not expecting much. The cabin itself is a filthy mess. A visit to the restroom midway across the Pacific and the floor is wet, it's smelly, there's tissue paper and seat covers all over the floor - I feel terrible for the individuals whom are seated next to toilets. The seat recline is next to non-existent and the seats themselves are hard and uncomfortable. I'll never fly intercontinental on United ever again and Domestic US travel is because of my desire to accumulate milage on Star Alliance carriers - otherwise I'd fly Delta.\", 'united airlines Los Angeles to London Heathrow with United. It took us about 25 minutes to check in and go through security. When we got to the gate area, we went to the United Lounge. The construction at LAX was going on, and the United Lounge was flooding so we had to go to the United Business/First Class Lounge instead. The Lounge was extremely overcrowded, and we had to wait 10 minutes just to get a seat. When we got to the gate, we boarded in 10 minutes. The plane was a 777-200, and it had comfortable seats. They served dinner after take-off. UA have the most amazing entertainment system. I slept until after breakfast, and when I woke up there was my breakfast on my tray however, the smell of the breakfast was repulsive, and I did not eat it. When we approached and circled around London, the captain flew around the city pointing landmarks out. When we landed, it took about 5 minutes to get off the plane.', 'united airlines Los Angeles to Newark with United. This flight was pretty good. When we got to LAX it took about 3 minutes to check in. The boarding took about 5 minutes and we were on the plane in no time. When we were in the air there were about 3 drink services on the whole flight. The entertainment screen had a lot of movies and TV shows. There was a normal amount of legroom. The only bad thing was that there was not much room to get out of the row to walk around the cabin. The seat cushion was loose and it moved around a lot.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Flew Houston to Los Angeles with United Airlines. 2 hour initial delay, then 2 more hours. 4 hours of delays due to maintenance, we were told too late so we couldn't get an earlier flight. Had to book a different rental car in LA which ended up costing me 100 dollars more than my intial car due to last minute reservations. 8 hours spent in the airport so I had to spend money on expensive airport food. Explained that to customer service, no apology, nothing. Maybe this is normal for United. The plane itself was fine, to be fair. Good space and friendly service in my experience. It's inexcusable to me not to compensate our flight in some way for this huge delay. Never flying United again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines flights from Chicago to Birmingham, AL delayed. Flights originally at 8.50 delayed until 12.00am because there was not enough aircraft's. At 11.37pm, we were told that there was no working crew for the flight and that they needed to call in a different crew. Can't blame the informer but this is ridiculous. The flight is only one hour and thirty minutes and I would rather reschedule but they won't let me unless it is delayed for more than 4 hours.\", \"united airlines Seattle to Little Rock via Denver with United. Several hours leaving Seattle due to mechanical problems and missed my connecting flight to Arkansas. Waited several hours for another flight, but missed our rental car time and took a taxi. Two days later on return, hours late leaving Arkansas, so missed connecting flight in Denver. Waited so long that when we finally got to Seattle, we missed our bus and ferry home, and had to spend the night. Ten days later, our daughter flew from Seattle to Fargo, ND, with a stop in Denver. Couldn't land in Denver due to weather, so missed her connecting flight to ND. Of course United would not pay for her hotel and she had to wait until next day. Then on return, got stuck in Denver again and had to stay overnight. A day late both ways. Will never use United again.\", 'united airlines New York to San Francisco with United Airlines. The flight was supposed to leave at 6:00am in the morning, the boarding procedure was done but we were made to sit for 1:30 hours inside the flight as there was a maintenance issue that they were trying to resolve (after boarding). Then they decide that it cannot be resolved and asked us to board another flight and we had to wait in the queue forever for the boarding procedure to be repeated. After boarding there was another wait of 30mins. The flight finally leaft at 9:00am. We spent another 40mins waiting for a gate for arrival. In short, I was supposed to reach my destination at 9:20am and here I am still in the flight at 12:40pm.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Landed at Newark on UA18 from Milanâ€“Malpensa, I had to board my connecting flight to Orlando UA730 scheduled for 2.55 pm. Despite an early landing in Milan, due to the lenghty custom procedures and the unavailability of the United Airlines personnel to assist me in expediting the process, despite my desperate running through the airport, I reached the gate too late for boarding. I had to take the later flight at 3.55. I missed a meeting in Orlando. The staff at the UA customer service desk were very unpleasant and were not be co-operative at all. I have to add that the 8.5 hour flight from MXP to Newark was also very unconfortable with poor quality food and noisy company. I complained to customer service and received a free ticket for a future flight with United for the value of 150 US Dollars. However, 6 days later, when on my way back to Italy from Florida I asked the UA personnel at MCO-Orlando to upgrade my ticket from Newark to Milano Malpensa UA19 to a business class ticket. The attendant at the counter told me that there were seats available, but an upgrade for my ticket was not available nor could I use the free ticket United gave me. If I wished to fly business class, I had to buy a new ticket. On my return flight (UA19) to Milan MXP from Newark on May 26, 2016 I again tried without success to get a more comfortable seat than the one assigned 45C (the very last seat on the rear right next to the lavatory). However, the cabin was full and the overbooking issue caused a delay in the departure. Despite my express request not to be seated near children or babies, I had a newborn sitting a couple of rows ahead of me. Luckily, he did not scream at all during the flight. Meals were of poor quality, as it was on the other flights of UA, were served and the crew ran out of red wine very early on. Due to the very overcrowded condition of the flight, I could only sleep a couple of hours thanks to the courtesy of a flight attendant who gave me earplugs.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | UA3345, Chicago - Washington on an E-175. Operated for United Airlines by Republic Airlines. This was the last leg of a nearly one-month trip that took me from PHL-DOH-KWI-DOH-PVG-DOH-KWI-DOH-LAX-YVR-ORD and now home to Washington. Of course, only on an American carrier do I find myself being spoken rudely to by member of the cabin crew. After boarding and taking my seat 2A (single seat by the window), I went to use the forward lavatory. The cockpit door was wide open with the captain, a young woman, sitting sideways in her seat. I greeted her and we started chatting. She was very interested to hear of several recent flights Iâ€™d had on the new A350 operated by QR. The FA in the first galley, interrupted me to say, â€œexcuse me sir, you are in my spaceâ€\\x9d. I replied, â€œIâ€™m speaking with the captainâ€\\x9d and moved slightly closer to the lavatory door. The captain and I chatted for a few more moments, then I went into the lavatory. Before the lavatory door was even shut, I heard the FA staying loudly to the captain, â€œIâ€™m sorry, he just started talking to youâ€\\x9d. I came out of the lavatory and said, â€œWhat is it that you are sorry for? I can speak to the captain before the door is closed and we push back from the gate. She was quite happy to have a conversation with meâ€\\x9d. The FA said nothing. I went to my seat. The FA then came to ask me if I wanted something to drink pre-departure. I told her that it was rude of her to say what she said to the captain in a loud voice and that she could, at the least, have said once I was out of earshot. Before I had even finished speaking she just walked away from me. She came back to my seat and I asked her, â€œdo you always just walk away while a passenger is speaking to youâ€\\x9d. She mumbled something which wasnâ€™t anything close to an apology. Unacceptably rude behavior and bad attitude toward a premium passenger in a first class cabin. Not such a nice ending to a long multi-segment trip.', 'united airlines My family and I were traveling to New Delhi, India in May from Newark and we were looking for a direct route from America to India to save time. The choices were between Air India and United. As we have tried Air India before, and we have not flown long haul with United for a long time, we decided to try out United\\'s much touted \"new cabin experience\" in Economy class, where a \"three course meal\" would be presented, as well as improved services for Economy passengers. We had hoped United had improved since the last, disastrous time we flew them in 2013, but alas. It is the same lacklustre airline. Check in at EWR was relatively painless, and the TSA, is the TSA. We boarded and left relatively on time, and so far, things looked alright. And we were wrong about that. The 777-200 was old, to say the least, and in a shabby condition. The seats were worn and my recline didn\\'t work- needless to say, for a 14 hour flight, this was simply not good enough, United. I was given a free drink to compensate, but a drink doesn\\'t help you when you\\'re stuck in an upright and uncomfortable position for 14 hours at 6 feet 3. My second gripe with this flight was the crew - and what a surly bunch they were. The \"three course meal\" much touted was not there - instead, we got served an awful mix of barbecue sauce and chicken, rice, and uncooked vegetables. There was no initial drinks run, and everything was served on one, tiny tray and due to this, our portion sizes were far too small. My son (aged 9) didn\\'t eat anything for 12 hours. Breakfast was little better, with a choice between an uncooked omelette and an Indian vegetarian meal. The only saving grace of this flight was the IFE, but the screens were worn and did not respond to touch controls and the remotes in the armrest did not work. We have flown flights of similar length on Qatar or Emirates, and it is important to note how wonderful the food was, on those 16 hour voyages, and the plentiful snacks (I say \"snacks\", they were literally meals), and the courteous crews. There was none of that on a United flight of similar, or even longer length. The abysmal meals, disinterested and indifferent crews (who were nowhere to be seen after the initial meal service), and the shabby, worn condition of the plane and seats mean that I do not recommend United on such long haul flights of more than 10 hours. It\\'s hard to believe that this airline is from Continental Airlines, which was (in my opinion), the best airline of America.', 'united airlines So disappointed. Very unsatisfactory flight from Kona to Los Angeles. Told it was a Continental plane now flying under United name. No comparison to our flight going in the other direction. Business section smaller, less leg room, no TV or video equipment at all. Seats not customizable. Attendant stated before take off, when you could not hear the muffled slurred comment something about downloading the United app to get TV or movies. She never said clearly and specifically the we needed to do so prior to take off. Once in the air, no way to see movies or TV on an almost 5 hours flight. Why should I have to download a United app, what if I had not had electronic items with me? Paid the same for a far different experience. On the other plane they handed out a portable tablet to watch entertainment. Come on United, get current. Food offerings were both full of dough, either ravioli or a calzone. Service adequate but not personable and acceptable. United you have lost me.', 'united airlines San Francisco to Hong Kong. I was looking forward to my first time flying with United in an International leg. I have enjoyed their Domestic/Transborder route quite a few times. I\\'ve read on their website the improvement they made on their in-flight services so I was excited to experience it. But I knew my excitement will short-lived when I stepped into the boarding lunge to take my flight. Announcements after announcements were made by the gate agent that the flight will be full and that all big carry on must be check in. The boarding process itself was chaotic and the UA gate agents in SFO seemed annoyed and you can hardly see anyone smiling and genuinely greeting travelers as they board. They all look like they just want to get the boarding over and pass it on to the flight crew to deal with the guest. Once onboard, I was looking for the \"Plus\" in what United called their \" Economy Plus\" seats section. The seat pitch is just what other Airline like NH/CX/SQ offers in their regular economy section. The aircraft is an old 747 and it is quite ready to retire. Seats looks and smells dirty and really really old. I am a short person (5\\'6) and my knees almost touch the seat in front of me.There is also in IFE box under the seat in front which limits my legroom. Food service was the one I was anticipating and see how United made an improvement. The first meal service was a total disappointment. I wish I am lying right now when I say the food was horrible and inedible. I didn\\'t finish my meal and only consumed the bread and veggies. THe second meal service was even worse. Noodles with no meat and it was so salty. Inflight entertainment is OK but on this aircraft, you have to download their Apps beforehand on your mobile device or else you will watch the Big Screen TV only that shows movie every 3hours. Flight Attendant are like robots and do a job without any emotion. Person next to me ask for another Ice cream and water and the FA told him that only one per passenger then left. FA\\'s are nowhere to be seen after they turn off the lights after the meal service. I get up almost every hour on a long flight to stretch and not once I saw an FA. They re-emerge 2hours before landing to serve the meal. FA\\'s are the worst I experience thus far travelling on an international flights. Now that I experienced UA International, I would pay extra to be on a different airline especially the Asian Carriers.', \"united airlines La Guardia to Los Angeles via Chicago with United Airlines. Bad information and bad handling of passengers after a severely delayed plane. UA 556 8:13pm from LGA. The departure's departure was severely delayed, by more than 1.5 hours. Sms messenges from UA did not reflect any of the information about the delay. After embarking a 25 mins delayed we would sit and wait in the plane for almost an hour, while we were let to know in different ways that we are ready to leave soon. Upon arrival, again little information, even though all conducting passengers obviously had lost their flights' departures. After waiting in line on an under staffed customer service, we were given the usual tricky hotel voucher trip and sent on a mission to find out how to get there. First on our way to a bus stop with such bad descriptions that almost all passengers were lost on the way to find the shuttle bus. Maybe because no one would actually think that we were supposed to cross an insecure road and go through a road construction site for finding it? After asking bus drivers from other hotel services we waited for 25 minutes for the shuttle to the Weston hotel. Now time had gone and the kitchen where we could use the 10 dollars worth coupon for 'a meal' where there happens to be no meals so cheap. As a partner of United Airlines, this hotel also comes without a complimentary internet connection service. I will not trust UA again unless they change information and passenger handling significantly, and I will as much as possibletry to avoid flying with them. United Airlines must be the worst airline in the Star Alliance.\", 'united airlines We flew from Buffalo, NY to Chicago and then to Maui in May 2016. The airline charges per suitcase. The female employee who was checking boarding passes at Buffalo was extremely rude. She got flustered when I pointed out that she had not given my niece\\'s passport back to her and she stated, \"I thought you were all together! Next time you need to get here earlier. I almost unseated all of you!\" To which I replied that we had looked up what time to be there on United\\'s website and it stated to be there an hour and a half before your flight, which we were. There was no entertainment available unless you brought your own hand held device. If you had your own hand held device, but didn\\'t have earbuds or headphones, they didn\\'t have any for you. It took my son six hours to watch a two hour movie because the WiFi kept shutting down. They charged us for the meals on a 9 hr flight - charged us for the Italian sandwich, which is what we ordered, but they gave us the turkey sandwich which was cheaper. If the food has improved (as I\\'ve seen from some reviews), I would have hated to eat it before. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable. We tried to upgrade and were told we couldn\\'t. We were traveling with six people all together. They ruined 3 of the suitcases, one of them brand new. The steward staff on the return flight from Maui were very nice, polite, and professional, but it did not make up for all that we had already experienced. I won\\'t take United again if it can be avoided. In short, United charges you for everything, but doesn\\'t give you much in return.', 'united airlines United Airlines was outstanding on my recent trip from Boston to London. I was originally booked to fly from Boston to London via Washington-Dulles airport but around 8 hours before departure, I received a notification that the flight from Boston to DC had been canceled. I called United and got through to a friendly agent who confirmed that I had already been rebooked onto a new itinerary via Newark that would get me to London only 3 hours later than originally planned. She booked me into an economy plus seat as I am a silver member and apologized for the cancelation. The check-in process had a couple minor problems at Boston as the self-service machine would not print a bag tag for me but an agent quickly assisted me at the counter. Boarding process was efficient -the new automatic ticket scanning gates at terminal B in Boston definitely speed up the process. I gate-checked one of my carry ons because it was too large to fit in the overhead bin. Onboard the short flight from BOS to EWR, there was personal device entertainment, which was a pleasant surprise as this was on a very small EMB-170 aircraft, which usually has no entertainment. Onboard service was minimal on this 45 minute flight and only water was offered. Nevertheless it was a comfortable flight. There was one small hiccup in the trip on arrival at Newark airport when I had to wait around 10 minutes to get my carry on back from gate check but I retrieved it in the end and everything went well with the connection. The long flight from Newark to London was very good with courteous and attentive flight attendants. Dinner was served promptly after take-off and the food was decent by airline standards. The only disappointment was that there was no dessert except for a small pot of sorbet which had a strange taste, and water was strangely only provided after the meal instead of before. Entertainment options were plentiful with personal device entertainment or seat back on demand with a varied selection. Seats were comfortable when reclined and there was plenty of leg room in economy plus. Upon arrival in London, the baggage claim process was very efficient and the bags were already on the belt by the time I got through customs. Overall, a seamless, comfortable and relaxed trip with United. In the past, I have had trouble with United but they are quickly learning from their mistakes and improving greatly. I will definitely continue flying with them in the future.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita. United's service has been on a continued downhill spiral since United bought Continental Airlines. I was a loyal and proud Continental Airlines customer before the buyout. I have reluctantly continued to fly United because the connections from Houston are still the best there is. However, the service is appalling. On this most recent trip I was changed a hefty 2nd bag fee. Even though my expensive United Club card allowed me 2 free bags and the code-share partner, ANA allows for 2 free bags. United has lost my ticket. As well as many other instances of mishandling by United. I hope that United listens to its customers and improves the service to the same level as the old Continental airlines, where I felt like I was treated like a human.\", 'united airlines Our United Airlines flight from Lima to Newark was fine, but the service was terrible. The flight attendants served dinner shortly after take off and never came around again until shortly before we landed in the morning, when they handed out a muffin. We did not get anything drink for breakfast because they waited too long to start the service and only managed to serve drinks to half the passengers. Not being offered anything to drink for 7 hours is simply unacceptable!', 'united airlines Puerto Rico to Boston with United Airlines. I have never gone so far as to publically give a rating or review in my 45 years of being on this earth. However, sorry to say I just had to this time. We recently were returning from vacation where my sons anxiety disorder worsened considerably and we had to get home quickly. We had the worst flying experience in all of our flying history. We had never flown United before. Never will again. My son has a medical issue as I mentioned. I planned ahead and paid for premium seats to assure we were all sitting together. Our flight before that came in with about 10 minutes to spare for us to board this connecting flight. By the time we got there, people were still in line to board. However, the desk agent \"removed\" us from the trip. They quickly realized that this decision was a little premature so they offered us some open seat tickets. None of course were next to each other. However, this is why I spent an hour on the phone with United the night before...to make sure we were together in case something happened with my son. I asked if they would be willing to talk to the other customers(travelers) and see if anyone would be willing to switch seats with us as it was the agent who removed us in the first place. He simply walked away. When he came back, I asked if we could resolve this. Apparently the lady next to him was already assigning the extra tickets now to someone else. We now with no choice of our own had to wait for the next flight which I luckily had pre-booked the night before just in case we truly did miss the connection. Only because united had sent us an email that the first flight was already delayed by an hour and a half. All during the process of this the desk agent kept talking to other people, never once apologized for the stress he was causing. He was extremely rude, and said that unless my son has a heart issue or has an oxygen tank that it wasnt his problem. When my son heard this, it immediately hit a nerve and the guilt of us having to deal with this agent in this way and the frustratingly awful customer service sent my son into a debilitating anxiety attack (looks like a seizure). Yet still the agent continued to be defensive. Not one apology, or assistance from anyone at that desk. Clearly, the trouble I had for over an hour on the phone with United the night before made no difference. When I asked if there was someone I could speak with to get further assistance I was told \"yeah, its called online\\'. Once we boarded, the level of professionalism was atrocious. The flight attendants could be heard talking about the men they dated, rammed the drink cart along passenger seats multiple times, could barely be bothered to actually listen to your order, forget about asking for a blanket. Thank you for your sympathy United for an already very tough situation.', \"united airlines San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale with United Airlines. For a red eye flight this plane was so dated and uncomfortable, very uncomfortable. The plane looked like it had seen better days, cigarette trays in the arm rest will give you an indication of its age and it looked as thought the leather was about as dated. Check in staff were not so friendly or helpful. I was a fan of Continental back before the merger, and thinking United would uphold some of the standards I have taken them on a few occasions - but clearly I'm mistaken and sadly disappointed with staff and specifically aircraft comfort and appearance. For a ride back in the 70s this is your airline.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Las Vegas to Oklahoma via Denver. I recently flew with United to Oklahoma to visit relatives, in May. When we did our self check in. We all had separate seats even my 3yr old daughter! I went to ask for assistance and was given the \"we can\\'t assist you with your seats, then she points to the sign \"bag drop off only\". She then said go sort yourself out at the gate. we got to the gate, and waited for someone to assist us at the service desk. When someone finally appeared. We asked if they could help us with the seating arrangements, because how could they seat a child on their own. We were told they couldn\\'t help with seating arrangements we needed to go to the ticketing desk, which was on the other side of the terminal! we were told we can go ask people to move so we could sit next to my daughter. Frustrating! Then before boarding we were stopped by the gate boarding attendant and was told we had too many bags! We are allowed two bags per person. There was four of us, we had seven bags. She made my mum ruffle around to consolidate our bags, but I told the attendant that my daughter is a person and we paid full price for her, She (my daughter) is allowed two bags! 2x4=8! The attendant then looked at me blankly and just let us through not even apologising for her mistake! Rude! A week later my parents return trip from Oklahoma was booked with United airlines. When they got there (their English is limited) they asked for assistance with the self check in. The two ladies that went to help them, told my parents they had too many bags. Again! My mum had two bags, dad the same. Mum was holding her jacket and a travel pillow for the flight. They bullied my parents to the point, that my mum said she didn\\'t want any more hassle and was happy to pay for the baggage fee. My mum had only cash, but they told my mum they don\\'t accept cash, only credit card! By this time it was almost boarding time for them, then a supervisor of the airline came to see what was the fuss, the supervisor told my parents that they can go because they have the correct amount of bags - just plain rudeness! No customer service! Would never recommend anyone to fly with them! United airlines horrible! If I had a choice I wouldn\\'t give them one star!', 'united airlines Shanghai to San Francisco with United Airlines. I chose to fly United as I couldnt face a China Eastern flight over such a distance and thought it would be nice to fly a US carrier for a change. Sadly dissapointment started when they took my bottle of water just outside the plane - (no bottled water given on board). I was quite suprised that the aircraft actually looked older than I did - not a good thing. No in seat entertainment and the premium economy seats were exactly the same as economy but you got a couple of extra inches legroom. There were instructions on how to use your own ipad and the United entertainment system but you could only do so if you had already downloaded the app - thanks for telling me in advance. Or I could pay $15.99 for wireless to download it. The food was awful, the pasta was rubbery and had a very odd taste, so on the way back on the same terrible plane got a sandwich from the deli near gate 102 - much better. Was it worth the money to upgrade to premium economy - no, except that I had an empty seat next to me on the way out. Will never fly United Airlines again. Only positive point the hostesses were very nice.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I booked United Airlines flight 3692 from Austin to MSP on May 11, 2016. There was an mechanical problem with the door so the passengers were diverted to other flights. The purpose of my trip was to attend my brother\\'s funeral, I had to be there on time. I explained my need to get to Minnesota before 1:30 and the AUS attendant got me onto the next flight to Houston to make the next flight to MSP which was scheduled to arrive at 1:17pm. The National Cemetery is right next to the airport and the time is approximately 10 minutes from the airport to the cemetery via the highway. At Houston, I asked the attendant if I could be off the plane first when it arrived at MSP. She said \"No\" but she did move my seat assignment closer to the door. I also asked if they could request a sky cab/cart upon landing so it could take me to the taxi cab stands located outside the airport. They made those arrangements for me. Fortunately the plane arrived 10 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time. The sky cab/cart arrived just as I got into the terminal. The driver whisked me as close as he could to the taxi cab stands and explained the quickest way to get to the taxis.

Much better than I expected. Flights were punctual. Aircraft cabins and toilets were clean. Food was tasty. Seats comfortable. Entertainment was barely ok, I like European films better than US and there were none. Water tasted awful but I have been warned about aeroplane water often enough to not take more than a sip.

The plane arrived at 6pm and was suddenly determined to have mechanical problems. Another plane arrived at 9pm. We finally boarded. The conveyor didn't work to load the baggage and the crew were not around to unplug it in order to restart it. It's 10.30pm and we are still stuck at the gate. We've had to book a hotel in SF and forget about our 2 hour drive home tonight or should I say tomorrow morning. This after having to upgrade to a premium seat for my wife because her seat was never assigned when the flight was booked online.

No fault of the nice people at the desk and on board, but never flying United again.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Overnight flight from Newark to Heathrow. We upgraded to premium economy for this flight and it was my first experience with UA. Boarding was smooth, assigned a row to join which was marked on the boarding pass. Welcomed on board and found the seats, two of us travelling and we discovered that no one was assigned to the third seat in our row which made it a bit more comfortable. Legroom was good although seat width felt a bit narrow and looked to be the same as economy. That was about it in the way of 'perks' compared to economy as far as I could see. As for the flight, one hour delay in taking off and strong winds delayed our arrival. Good choice of entertainment. Meals were reasonable and I managed to get a brief nap. I had a look at the economy legroom and it looked poor, so I was glad we upgraded but I would class it as only extra legroom rather than a premium product.\", 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Munich with United Airlines, and this is by far one of the worst airlines I have flown. Their online check-in did not work, so for our 8 hour long trip to Germany my husband and I ended up sitting in separate rows although the flight was not full! The airline was trying to squeeze $169 per person out of us to sit next to each other in Premium Economy, but gave away free seat upgrades to Business class! How is there not something wrong with this picture? The worst customer service.', 'united airlines Flew United Airlines from Sacramento to Boston. The seats on the plane were unbelievably small and the airline changed our itinerary and moved our group of four all apart from each other and all in middle seats even though we had selected better seating when we booked the flight four months earlier. The customer service on the phone when we called to change the seating back was rude and very unhelpful. The staff at the check in desk were able to help us on one of the flights and we were able to at least not all have middle seating. Even with a window or aisle the seats are the most uncomfortable with zero leg room.', \"united airlines Newark to Dallas Ft Worth with United Airlines.

We experienced a weather delay. storms in Las Vegas prior to departure. The captain let us off the aircraft and the gate team gave us updates every 15 minutes on what was happening. Even when the gate staff changed shift the updates keep happening. It was very professional and made the delay manageable. Onboard service was great and despite being a 43 minute flight a quick beverage and snack service. Surprising as the cabin crew had to ran to make this happen.', 'united airlines Flew on United Airlines Boeing 737 aircraft from Seattle to Kahului return via San Francisco. Updated slim seats that gives medium sized economy passengers more legroom. Satisfactory drink service and moderately cheerful FAs who went about their business. The aircraft on both legs were on time and even a bit early. Unitedâ€™s new â€œzesty ranchâ€\\x9d snack was too spicy, salty and generally inedible. There is now paid DirecTV service on 737 seatbacks with non-stop advertising running in a loop from the minute you board the aircraft constantly nagging you to swipe a credit card. Sadly, neither DirecTV nor in-flight wifi worked over the Pacific, which made the whole entertainment system pointless for the 5 hour crossing. It also looks like United has also removed the music channels, including my personal favorite, flight deck chatter. For those used to the Alaska Airlines â€œMai Taiâ€\\x9d service on Seattle-Hawaii flights, thatâ€™s a hefty $9.99 on United. In short, United will get to your destination and back safely, and thatâ€™s about it.

At my gate, I asked the attendants if I could have my skateboard checked like a stroller, but I was told no, and that it wold have to be paid for as baggage. I didn't want to do that because last time I did, my board was damaged. I politely tried to tell them this, but I was continually ignored or told they couldn't do that, in a rude and unfriendly fashion. I decided I would simply pay rather than leave my board, and got onto the plane. I then sat on the plane, which was already delayed from 3:13 to 3:30, for over 2 hours while totally uninformed of what the issue was or when we would depart or arrive in San Francisco. We eventually left around 5:50 and I subsequently missed my connecting flight to Seattle at 6:51. I will not be flying United ever again.\", 'united airlines Seattle to Orlando via Houston, and this was my first time flying with United by myself and connecting flights. The flight from Seattle to Houston was not the greatest since we had to be diverted to another city due to weather and lack of fuel. The flight was super bumpy and this caused me to miss my connecting flight from Houston to Orlando, but United gave me a partial voucher for my hotel accommodations and I was just grateful to be safe. I also had the hope of making an early flight the next morning so I could return home and get back to work from the conference I was attending. Due to weather conditions and staff shortage, I had 5 rescheduled flights delayed then canceled. I was even about to board 2 of the 5 and the staff just said, \"Sorry, these are canceled,\\' without any further explanation. I received no hotel voucher the second night, and since I was trying to get on several flights throughout the day, the hotels got full and I had no where to sleep. Fearing that I would face a 6th canceled flight, I made other travel accommodations and finally got out of that miserable city. I get that many airlines were canceling flights due to the horrific weather conditions, but I was astonished at the lack of communication, empathy, kindness, and understanding we received from the United staff. I understand that we may receive full vouchers or refunds due to weather but at least be courteous. I then come to find out that my refund request for the ticket seemed to come back approved but upon further investigation I found that I will only receive a partial refund since United technically got me to one of the two cities. I just wish I got more understanding and communication throughout the process, and that\\'s the main reason why I\\'ll never fly with United again and will encourage those around me to not choose United either.

Awful customer service!\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | We travelled with United Airlines in Domestic First and International Business class from Las Vegas to Dublin via Washington, the return leg of an earlier DUB-IAD-SAN booking. Checked in at LAS at a staffed desk, this was quick friendly and efficient. After security, which was quiet at the time of the process, we made our way to the Lounge for a 1+ hour wait. Plenty of drinks and nibbles were available and the food area was clean and tidy. It was too early in the day to use the bar! Boarding was by the standard UA â€˜Groupâ€™ System, and being in the first group as stated the boarding pass this was completely painless. On board welcome drinks were offered prior to departure. Meal orders for lunch were also taken. After departure we noticed that the aircraft appeared to level off a bit early and that turns were being made over the Lake Mead area. This manoeuvre lasted for about 10+minutes which we found to be slightly alarming. My co-traveller mentioned this to one of the FAs who advised that â€˜systemsâ€™ were being checked. No flight deck announcement was ever made on this situation. Once the aircraft started to climb again and it was obvious that the aircraft was on course for IAD we were able to relax more and enjoy the well presented lunch and numerous top ups of wine! In spite of the unusual post departure manoeuvres the flight arrived at the gate in IAD a few minutes early. We checked the gate number for the onward DUB flight which was departing a few gates away on the same concourse. We were able to use the UA lounge at IAD for a short stay, this facility was heaving at the time of our mid evening visit so perhaps not so enjoyable. Boarding for Dublin flight commenced about 20 minutes late due to the aircraft's delay from a previous flight. On board the FA in charge greeted each Business-First passenger, and as on the previous sector drinks were service prior to departure along with orders for dinner. Inflight, dinner and more drinks were served. Having eaten earlier there was actually too much food on offer! We did notice that most fellow travellers had skipped the final cheese and desert courses to try and get some sleep. Around 1.5 hours out of Dublin a breakfast was served. The aircraft arrived 10 minutes early. From the gate it was a fair walk along corridors to the immigration and customs area which was near empty at the time of our visit. To conclude, the service on all sectors was great. The tickets purchased in â€˜Pâ€™ booking class which originated in Dublin were competitively priced, and worth the extra trip from Edinburgh.\", 'united airlines Houston to Denver with United Airlines.

At the end I was supposed to be at my final destination at 11 am - I made it until 11 pm. To compensate my lost day United Airlines throw me a 2 digit quantity voucher. I guess is the best they can do for you if they feel you deserve it and that's what you are worth to them.

D terminal at IAD is little better than a Quonset hut with carpeting, and Terminal 7 at LAX is a smelly, dirty disgrace made even worse by blaring security announcements every few minutes. The United Clubs in both places are old, tatty, dirty and full of people having loud, self-important conversations on cellphones since UA does nothing to regulate this kind of conduct. The Boeing 772 service to LAX was fully loaded, boarding was orderly, except that the cabin crew did nothing to assist disabled passengers to get seated and sorted before the rest of us got on. It was the same with disembarkation at LAX, so the aisles were brought to a standstill by poor people with physical limits trying to get on and off with the rest of us. The 772 was old and showing it. Things did not work. My IFE system went on the fritz. An FA willingly reset it and then checked, and when it still did not recover, gave me a coupon which I later used online to add 5,000 points to my Mileage Plus account. The inflight wifi also did not work for me 90 percent of the time, but my neighbour could use it it, albeit with very slow up and down speeds. One has to apply online for a refund. The Boeing 787 LAX-MEL was still new and fully functional, and this time the food was edible, though the portions were minuscule, and with dinner service about 1 hour after lift off and breakfast about 1 hour before landing, the 12-13 hours without food in between seemed long, even to me who is not a big eater, though one can buy food from the food for purchase menu. The crew on this leg were short on customer service skills, barking out requests, never a \"please\" or \"thank you\" and not a single hydration round. They seemed pretty sour about something, but when I went to the rear galley to find an empty restroom, a few of them were sitting around and chatting in a very jovial way with each other. Toilets not maintained at all for the 15 hours. Even so, we were on time, things went efficiently, the IFE choices were good, and the IFE system on the B789 was very good. If the hard product on the old 772s is upgraded and the effort to promote customer service skills among cabin crew continues, the improvement in United\\'s service I\\'ve noticed over the last couple of years might just continue.', 'united airlines âœ… Verified Review | We had 4 flights with United Airlines, first flight was from Manchester UK to Newark.

On 2nd internal flight from Newark to Miami, 3 seats allocated to us were scatted throughout the plane, we are a family of 2 adults 1 child (5) and a baby. This should not be allowed and after complaining they gave us 3 together. Service onboard was much better than the international flight with great attendants. 3rd internal flight Miami to Newark the worst with very rude staff on the check-in desk who ignored us for about 10-15 minutes. Again we requested an infant cot for our international flight and were told we had it as we were one of the first to check in, flight delayed and only just made our connection to 4th flight by seconds. Asked for our sky cot only to be told sorry someone asked for it on the plane and they had given it to them. I said I was unhappy as we requested it 6hrs ago and were met with very rude cabin staff. A very unpleasant experience throughout.', 'united airlines Our flight from Chicago to Boston with United Airlines was unacceptable, from start to finish. To begin, our flight was changed at the very last minute, and our seats were changed/not assigned. We called the airline immediately for information, and the only information we received was that they were unable to do anything until we were at the gate, forcing us to go to the airport much earlier in order to figure out what was going on. Once we arrived, we were misinformed about placing ourselves on the standby list in regards to the fact that we were even able to be on the list with checked baggage and we would be provided a refund. When we asked about what would happen to our checked bags, we were then forced to be taken off of the standby list, thus, not using this service. The service quality while on the flight was not horrible, but the service leading up to the flight was not acceptable. Once we were charged for the standby list, the service we received was even worse. We were told that we would not be able to receive a refund, and then told we would have to submit a request online. All of the individuals we spoke with were rude, confused, or both. If you are adamant about flying with this airline, please do yourself a favor and understand everything that you need to have before/during/after your flight (checked bags, times you need to leave by, WiFi which is NOT included, etc.). As new flyers, I have to say that this airline was not helpful at all.', 'united airlines Melbourne to LA on United Airlines. Smooth check in and boarding facilitated by very pleasant ground staff. United uses the Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne which is small and has a very narrow range of amenities. On board, the aircraft had a nicely appointed interior. UA uses a 2x2x2 configuration in business class which feels cramped. The seat was fairly comfortable but lacked storage space. The FA that looked after our section of the cabin was disengaged and uninterested. Lunch and breakfast were mediocre and the mid-flight snacks were simply abysmal. Wine selection was limited and labels available were well below what a business class offering should be. Part way through the flight I enquired if the aircraft was equipped to offer espresso coffees. The FA said it was but they were never supplied with the pods and that UA was planning to rip them out. This is a clear sign that UA is simply not interested in providing a differentiated service. IFE had a decent range of movies but music selection was not great. Toilets were not attended to very frequently as evidenced by the clutter and lack of supplies. Overall a disappointing business class experience.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | I will never fly United again. Flew from Minneapolis to Chicago O'Hare.

The first was in Chicago, IL at nght and my connecting flight was even delayed and in the gate right next to the gate I was in. But my bag made it on that flight, but I didn't. They didn't even pay for an overnight hotel. So I was in Chicago overnight with nothing! Now they did it again, but this time in Fresno, CA. It is true, you get what you pay for! I will gladly pay more money from here on out to fly any other airline. Heck, I'd drive before flying this airline again.\", \"united airlines Worst customer service experience. I understand that flights get delayed and cancelled. There is a way to handle them when they do. We had a connecting flight from ft. Lauderdale to United's hub in Newark today. After we got off that flight everything was handled poorly - our flight was cancelled without even a hours notice or any explaination why, we were offered standby on two flights to Detriot and a 3rd option of staying the night(without compensation for a room) in Chicago and going to Detriot in the morning(3 pretty poor options). We were told no flights would be able to connect us to Detriot until the following day. After both of the standby flights were delayed we asked a different customer service desk to put us on a flight to Grand Rapids, which they were able to do. Once we arrived in Grand Rapids, our only checked bag was not on the plane. At no point was the staff willing to do the right thing. It is clear United's policy is to make a quick dollar and run over customers to do so.

The aircraft cabin was quite clean and the seats were comfortable, the flight attendants were friendly when serving food and drinks to passengers. There was a choice of chicken noodles and scrambled eggs for the in-flight meal, I chose chicken noodles for my meal, unfortunately it was not to my liking as the noodles were too dry.

My daughter who flew the same time we did via Southwest - both her flights going and coming back home were on time. I will not fly United again if I can help it. I will spend extra money just so I can fly on another airline other than United. Gas has gotten cheaper and the airline could not forego charging for luggage check which further delays the flight since everyone wants to carry their suitcases with them to the plane to avoid the fees. We were in Group 5 last night and people who had their suitcases with them had to check them in for free because there was no more room available for their bags in the plane and I think this is not fair because my husband and I checked in our small bags and we had to pay for them. It seems this is a punishment for people who check in their bags and for those who did not and then at the last minute had to check them in because of lack of room for their bags for FREE!

No one expalined the situation until 2 hours later. There was no apologies or complimentary coffee to help make the long wait bearable. I understand that is always a risk when flying but I waited in line for over 4 hours to be rebooked onto a flight and given a hotel voucher so vague not even the staff at Dallas could tell me what to do (I would be in Cozumel a day late). No information on the hotel number or address or shuttle. Just the name and there were two in the city. Not being from the US I then had to use roaming charges to try and find my reservation.

Even the return flight for the baggage is limited to one bag, even though we are with Air New Zealand. Called the airline and the answer is that you have to go with United rules of baggage and can not pre pay for excess baggage - you have to pay at the airport $200.00 against $1.00 which Air NZ is charging for excess baggage as a promotional.

This would cost us $288 per person for a 45 minute flight back to Honolulu to Kauai plus a $400 change fee. Totaling just under $1000 for a 45 minute, 1-way flight. After being rudely spoken to and blamed for a mistake we couldn\\'t have made, we were told to \"have a nice day\" and promptly hung up on. We immediately called another airline, we were on the phone for less than 10 minutes and booked a connecting leg from Kauai to Honolulu for $178 total. Easy to say the customer service and reliability with United is completely shot and we will never use this airline again. Travelers beware!', \"united airlines Tel Aviv to Los Angeles via Newark with United Airlines is very uncomfortable. The plane is crowded. The entertainment screens don't work well (screen get stuck or not responding properly to touch). The worst thing was that my luggage was gone due to a change in flight schedule and the help I got was very limited. I was rescheduled for the next flight because I missed my flight (delayed at the airport just because it was too busy), so I had to spend the night at the gate with no help nor compensation from their representatives! I don't want to experience this day again!\", \"united airlines Tampa to San Francisco. I hate to give a bad review but my latest experience with United Airlines was not a good one. I flew from Tampa to Denver to San Fransisco. My evening flight was very full and about 45 minutes delayed. The staff was not equipped or prepped for this. They were unpleasant and neglectful. My seat was by the window for the 4 hour flight with an elderly couple on the aisle side and absolutely no room to move around. When they got up to use the restroom, I took the opportunity as well. There was a snack truck on one end and it wouldn't allow anyone through so I went to the front to use the restroom. As I was waiting, the flight attendant told me that I needed to wait for the snack cart and use the back restroom. Since the older couple was done, I didn't want them to have to get up again and had to wait until we landed to use the restroom. I have been on Southwest before when a full flight was delayed for 20 minutes and the passengers were all given access to all channels but nothing was done on this fight. But the worst part about this flight is still sticking with me and I pray that this man is okay today. As we were departing the plane, a man was obviously slouched over into the aisle. It was clear to all of the passengers around that this man was not asleep but unconscious. A passenger was taking his pulse and another yelling for help. There were no attendants around to help with this man or with anyone else on this very crowded flight. That kind of service is inexcusable. Because of the delay, I missed my connecting flight which had been bundled by United. I went to customer service and there were about 50 people in line. I called customer service while in line and the lady booked me for what she said was the next flight at 5:58 am-7 hours later and offered no accommodations. My husband called and they put me on a flight that was boarding as I stood in line and only 2 gates away. I was relieved and tired. I got on the plane and found it way more comfortable and with more leg room-would have been nice for the previous full flight. I was having trouble lifting my carry on to stow it and had to ask an attendant to help as he watched me struggle with it. By this time, I still had not used the restroom. This flight was delayed and I had to wait even longer. As I sat down to rest, the cart came by with drinks. The lady didn't even ask me for a drink because I guess she assumed I was asleep. She did however splash me with juice for someone else and didn't say anything. I will try my hardest not to fly with United again!\", 'united airlines Houston to London with United Airlines, and the plane broke down causing over 2 hour delay. Very basic plane with narrow, uncomfortable seats. Offhand staff serving almost inedible food. As I went to Costa Rica and back via Houston I actually went in four different airplanes of different types, but all were just as bad. Add this to the rude and inefficient staff at Houston airport and I would not fly United Airlines or via Houston again. Not a nice end to an otherwise super holiday.', \"united airlines Orlando to Denver with United Airlines. We upgraded to first class tickets. When arriving in firat class we were told the seat I had did not recline, but I could still sit in it. After 10 minutes of waiting for everyone to board I was then told I couldn't sit in it. Myself and 4 year old daughter were told we had to move to coach. That was fine, but we were told to talk to the gate when we arrived to get a refund. When arriving at the gate we were told they can't help us we have to call United.com. We called United.com and after waiting on hold they said they can't help us, we have to do it online. After trying four different spots online to ask for a refund we were told everytime our request could not be processed. Horrible customer service and no one will help us.\", 'united airlines Phoenix to Boston via Houston with United Airlines. I sat behind a family with two toddlers who stood on their seats, ran up and down the aisles and screamed the entire flight. I understand airline staff can\\'t do much about the screaming, that is the job of the parents, however even when staff had to ask for the kids to be removed from the aisle so they could get the beverage cart from one end to the other, they never reminded the parents to keep the kids seated. Right in front of these \"parents\" there was a mom with one kid the same age and he was a perfect angel the entire ride. So to the parents who could not control your horrible children - a fail! To United Airlines for not caring about the safety of these two brats and those of us that had to get hit in the shin with the seat belt one of them was swinging around - even bigger fail!', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | This is a critique of a United Airlines Business Class trip Toronto to Hawaii return. The inflight entertainment was inoperable in all of the segments which is indicative of how much United it letting it's equipment fall apart. The business class seats to sit in are comfy, but the recline pitch is so insignificant that we were unable to catch any sleep on what was a very long trip. Being 6ft 2 inches my leg room was primarily found under the seat in front of me. When my seat mate needed to go to the washroom, the dynamic was equaled to the struggles of the same issue in economy. We got only one meal outbound and inbound and the rest of the time is was saly snacks with only one attempt at beverage services. It reminded me of what the economy class used to be. Paying big money for this service is unethical. So now it's time to take my business elsewhere. Travelers be warned!!\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Cancun return with United. If you find a cheap ticket, by all means take it, but you have to forget about customer service. The attendants are not going to give a damn about you. I asked for a glass of water and I was told to wait until they would come around with the cart which happened half an hour later. They promise wifi but most of the time it doesn't work. Even if the aircraft has TV's they do not provide a single free movie or show to watch. They do not give you a snack for a 4:30 hr flight, and the seats do not recline. Just be prepared for a few hours of torture.\", \"united airlines Washington Dulles to Tokyo Narita with United Airlines. I had high hopes that a US airline would be a better choice but it was one of the worst flights I've ever been on. It was a 14 hour flight and the seats were hard as a rock and they provided no way to charge your devices unless you wanted to pay for first class. Our second leg from Tokyo to Bangkok was with ANA and the flight attendant service was much better - United needs to take some lessons from them. I tried to do the inflight survey but that didn'the even work. I give United Airlines a big fat zero all around.\", \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Flight 4914 from EWR to AVP, March 24 2016. Our flight was delayed for something like two hours because of United's incompetence and inability to have a plane and crew ready for a scheduled flight. When the plane finally arrived at about 23:40 (the scheduled departure was 22:06), we were put onto a bus that drove us 50 or 100 yards (walking distance) onto the tarmac. We were then stranded in the bus for 35 minutes with no explanation, and not allowed to get off the bus. In other words, United doubled down on its incompetence and unreliability by further inconveniencing its passengers by directing them to board a bus and then demonstrating what I construe as willful and intentional contempt for the passengers by stranding them in the bus with no explanation. I recall that one person had to ask to use the toilet before the flight left because, even though most people probably did so before being told to board, the delay due to the airline's incompetence and disregard for its customers resulted in the need to do so again.\", 'united airlines Flew United Airlines from Birminham UK to Nashville with a connection to Nashville via Newark. No problems there. Before we were due to board at Newark, the flight got cancelled. We tried to get some answers from some of the United ground staff but we were told different reasons. One mentioned technical problems and others said it was a weather problem. However, other airlines took off for the same destination. After some time we were told that we could get a connecting flight the next day and we had to find some chairs to sleep in overnight. The next day the flight was cancelled again and we were offered an alterative flight to Memphis, which we took. Arrived at Memphis to find that our baggage was somewhere else. Tried to get information at Memphis about our baggage but hit a brick wall. No one there could help or take resposibility over our problem. After a few hours and some phone calls, we found that our baggage had been flown to Nashville. We hired a car from Paylesss Hire at Memphis for the day and got ripped off for hundreds of Dollars for one day hire to Nashville. Got the car back to Payless at Nashville airport after a few hours and they tried to rip us off for another fifty dollars. The problems continued and all I can say at this point is fly with a different airline, because when we got to Nashville, some of the baggage was still missing.', \"united airlines âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, on a new Boeing 737-900. Due to busy time at LAX airport, flight departure held at Las Vegas for 20 minutes but arrived on time. As flight time is only 45 minutes, cabin crew did not commence in-flight service with cart, only offered water to passengers. Smooth check-in, on-time arrival but baggage delivery at LAX needs to be quicker. Even as premier passenger I had to wait for 30 minutes before I got my luggage delivered, can't imagine how long other passengers had to wait.\", 'united airlines The trip to Denver was good. However, leaving Denver was not so good. On the flight out they cancelled 4 of my flights. By the time the final flight got cancelled it took 3 hours to rebook and United rep stated we could not get out till Saturday midday. I finally agreed to that flight. I then asked if they would provide any voucher for hotel or taxi because we were stuck in Denver for 3 days. They said they would not because it was weather related. So I had to flip the bill for the next few days. I then spent the next 4-5 hours on the phone with United to get a better flight time. To sum it up, United Airlines was not very helpful at all.', 'united airlines I was scheduled to fly to Providence through Newark on March 17 2016. My first flight was from Toronto to Newark at 11:05AM. I arrived to the airport at 9am, and so I had an hour before the gates closed. Unfortunately it took 40 mins to find parking, and by the time I got to the check-in, I had 15 mins to spare. There was an agent chatting and paying no attention to customers, so given I had very little time left, I thought I\\'d use the self check-in machine. Those machines are not very user friendly at all! It wouldn\\'t recognize the name of the city where I was staying and the name of the hotel. I was timed-out after trying 3 times, and only when I exasperated loudly did the check-in lady look up and nonchalantly say, \"If you\\'re having trouble go over there.\" Over there was the other end of the booths, where an agent seemed oblivious to her surroundings. By the time I rushed to her and handed my passport, she told me that I was late and wasn\\'t going anywhere. Then she pointed out that I had a checked bag and so I was definitely not getting on this flight. I raised my voice out of despair, and explained to her that I had spent 15 minutes trying to figure out their machines. I was even the one who \"apologized\" saying it wasn\\'t her fault. Instead of her apologizing for being inconvenienced by the airlines for whom she works, she had the nerve to look up at the other agent and ask her if I was telling the truth! She then told me she could get me on a flight that\\'ll get me to Providence by 11:55PM. That\\'s when I told I needed to be there in the afternoon because I had a rental. Of course, she wouldn\\'t override the system and open the gate, claiming it was too late even though it was an hour before boarding. She then sai, how about the flight through Chicago that\\'ll get me to Providence by 9:55. Asking me like I even have a choice in the matter. The agents were unprofessional, rude and not paying attention. The self check-in machines are horrible.', \"united airlines United Airlines from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. A less than an hour flight. More than satisfied with United this time. On time departure, early (like 20 mins) arrival. Fast baggage handling as well as smiling cabin crew members. Plane looks a little bit old but it's a short flight anyway. The only drawback is cabin crew didn't manage to serve all passengers. The last 5 rows of passengers couldn't get their drinks because the plane needed to land already. Maybe next time cabin crew need to serve faster.\", 'united airlines Chicago to Austin with United and they gave away my \"confirmed\" window seat, and stuck me in middle for an almost 3 hour flight. Person at gate counter was beyond rude and flat lied to me about assigning a window seat to another economy passenger right in front of me. I was the 2nd person at gate, a full hour before flight and was told just because my reservation had an assigned seat, that it wasn\\'t guaranteed. (What is the point of making advance reservations?) Some airlines seem to have forgotton about customer service and the fact our money keeps them in business. I will not fly with them again.', 'united airlines Rating would be 0 out of 10, if this was allowed. We left home at noon on Thursday, with an expected arrival time in Greensboro of 6:45pm Thursday - tickets for a concert Friday night. In Toronto, we pulled away from the gate on time, and sat on the runway for over 90 minutes, with the pilot telling us periodically that there was \"bad\" turbulence in Washington, and we\\'d be advised as soon as he heard anything. After 90 minutes, he turned back to the gate for refueling without having heard anything more. Some passengers were able to get rerouted immediately but the ground crew told us no issues - if there was bad turbulence, our connections would be backed up too. After 45m on the ground we went back out and eventually landed at Dulles. But our connecting flights had all left, so waited another 45m to get an alternate flight (Friday at noon). CSR said the issue was air traffic, not turbulence, so not their problem that we haven\\'t any place to stay here and an expensive, paid-for hotel room waiting for us in Greensboro. After being questioned more insistently, the CSR grudgingly gave us a voucher that got us a discounted (not free!) hotel room. Back to the airport today - at 10:30, 11, 11:30, the board still showed our flight as \"on time\". After the scheduled boarding time of noon came and went, checked with the gate agent - flight is now delayed to 3pm. We can only hope, since if they cancel it (the flight isn\\'t full) and put us on the 5pm flight, we won\\'t make Greensboro in time for the concert. I\\'ll hopefully never fly United again. Ultimately, we could have driven in the time we\\'ve spent in airports so far, and probably could have driven from Washington to Greensboro in the time we\\'ve spent at the airport today.', \"united airlines Tokyo-Narita to Boston Logan via Chicago O'Hare. I was returning from a study abroad trip to Japan and it was taking forever to board the plane and get into the air. Seats on the old Boeing 747-400 were uncomfortable and there was so little space for me to stretch out my legs. There was no inflight entertainment except for one big screen that showed movies. Food service was okay, I enjoyed the chicken katsu curry they served. Flight delayed a bit at Chicago, but when we were finally boarding, the flight was full so they had to take carry-on bags and stow them with the checked luggage. Pretty disappointed that United Airlines couldn't find a way to fix that problem. Flight was really crowded so I felt squished in and couldn't move that much. In total, I wouldn't fly with United Airlines again.\", 'united airlines I flew HNL back to LAX on 26 February on a Boeing 757-300. A nice touch on initial welcome onto the plane was being offered a cup of coffee. I had paid extra for an exit row seat and there were 2 passengers next to me. The flight attendant advised that the next block of exit row seats in the back cabin were all vacant if we wanted to relocate. The flight left HNL on time and arrived in LAX early. The crew were friendly and courteous. My only criticism was as this was a 7:00am departure, there wasnâ€™t really any breakfast options or a meal service available on this flight. Luckily I had breakfast in the United Club lounge before departure.', \"united airlines Shanghai to Chicago. The flight itself isn't bad - it's efficient and direct. But, right after you board with your group, and they scan your ticket, they will lead you to a Second Checkpoint. This checkpoint will relieve you of liquids. Note that since you've already gone through the airport security which removes all liquids, everything they take from you was bought or filled right there in the secured area of the airport. And this includes liquor bought from duty free. On the flight water bottles are passed out twice for most of the cabins (during the 15 hour flight), but the poor souls back in economy have to Pay to get water. I have to assume this second checkpoint policy is about extracting more money from you both in concession sales and duty free.\", 'united airlines I flew United Airlines from Paris CDG to Raleigh, NC, via New York. Terrible experience. The flight was delayed two hours at Charles de Gaulles. An unplanned refuelling stopover was added at Bangor because of strong headwinds over the Atlantic. Arrived in Bangor in the evening, around 7pm. Stop was supposed to be a matter of 45 min but the crew announced there was a mechanical issue and a mechanic had to intervene. Waited for mechanic in the plane for two hours. After two hours were told to disembark because finally, the crew could legally not fly anymore. Were told to go into the terminal. Waited there for about three hours after which we were told we would do our immigration clearance in Bangor. Did immigration clearance but were then told to basically sleep over at the airport as our plane would only take off at 9am next day. So basically, all passengers slept on the floor at Bangor airport till the next day. Avoid United like the plague. That airline is just awful. Rating other aspects of the airline low as the plane (757) is old and cannot understand why they fly it between Paris and NY if it can barely make the distance non-stop.', \"united airlines This was my fourth time flying with United Airlines and it was the best experience I've had with them. The plane had a new seat design that offered a little more comfort than the previous flights. The seats also had power outlets. The inflight entertainment was not very good. The entertainment consisted of the TV playing the same video the entire 4 hour flight and the only way to change the channel was to pay $6. This was a huge disappointment to other flights I have taken where United offered free movies and some TV shows. Overall though I was pretty impressed with United and their staff.\", 'united airlines Las Vegas to San Francisco with United Airlines - non-existent customer service. Airport staff said call toll free number, phone agent said talk to airport staff.

In both directions, our flights were either delayed or we were unable to get on a connecting flight due to long lines. The airline put us on two different standby flights, and customer service said they would not pay for a hotel if we did not make it on the flights. Service was rude and condescending. I had a similar issue when I flew United a few years back, but suffice it to say I will not be flying with this airline again.', 'united airlines Tokyo Narita to Newark with United Airlines.

That\\'s pretty lousy for a 12 hours flight. Only had one option of food.', 'united airlines Delay after delay. Nothing happens without a delay with United. United has decided that making people sit for hours in an airport is what they do best and they do it over and over. I always arrive early enough to navigate security and check in then have a less than hour wait until boarding, but with a new delay every twenty minutes you find yourself growing frustrated, agitated and then hungry. Of course United has no concern, they are not accountable, you always can pay for airport \"food\". My flight from George Bush Airport to Philadelphia Airport was also delayed multiple times. They claim to be on time more than they are not, but I a unable to verify more than 100% of the time there are delays. Service is mediocre as well, with staff seeming bored or tired of their jobs.', \"united airlines Honolulu to Toronto. United is by far the most incompetent and disorganized airline. Start to finish everything went wrong. Many people missed flights because of how grossly understaffed they were. Not one of my four flights left on time. On the 7 hour flight they ran out of food in the first 25 minutes. And the food they did have was disgusting. United couldn't even get my checked baggage to my destination on time then went on to lose it entirely on the way home. Now, months later I have no bag and no compensation for it. Don't even bother calling customer service, there's usually at least 30 minute wait times. Never again.\", 'united airlines Lincoln, NE to Los Angeles via Denver.

I am so used to Delta upgrading at the gate for free if asked if no one has purchased these seats. Apparently United doesn't care if they are just empty. If you don't pay, you may not upgrade even if the seat is empty during your flight and no one is purchasing it. Nice way to treat your customers. Now I know why I prefer Delta. I also found that the counter people seemed to be dismissive and uninterested in helping. I got an attitude from one counter person because I interrupted her conversation about her vacation when talking to another counter person. Sorry.\", \"united airlines Fort Lauderdale to Newark. The seats and the plane was fine. The employees were the worst I've seen in years. From the ticketing agent to the attendants, they were was rude and dismissive. As a regular traveler, I've learned not to expect much in the way of customer service from any airport experience. I keep my head down and expect some bumps along the way. There is little recourse no matter what happens when up against these types of companies. They know full well they can throw you out if you don't comply. We were yelled at and if we didn't answer in time, they would quickly repeat the question over and over getting louder each time. They were very busy, but that is the job. They need to train their employees to better handle pressure while being gracious.\", 'united airlines United Airlines is a very chintzy airline with a rather unpleasant corporate culture, but I do find them to be reliable out of Newark Airport. The flight went right on time, but the legroom was very limited, the seats were uncomfortable, and their new free snack mix (that they are so proud to be offering) was small and barely edible. I flew Jetblue on this same route and it was a much better experience. United is not keeping up with the competition.', 'united airlines I booked my flight from Anchorage to Pittsburgh 4 months in advance. We picked the specific dates and times based upon having multiple children including a baby and to be able to make a family reunion. United turned around and changed our flight to only give us a 4 hour layover from a 1.5 hours, they also made us miss our family reunion. On top of that they changed our flight home to go from having our flight be 5 hours to almost 10. They had no empathy, had nothing to offer and was not willing to give me any type of compensation. This is the second incident that have encountered with them. My recommendation would be to never fly with United.', \"united airlines A party of 4 of us flew out to New York from Heathrow with United Airlines, and we had a great experience going out, everyone was so friendly and helpful. Coming home was a totally different experience, we were ordered (not asked), to join one queue then another several times after waiting in line for ages.

This should be a requirement for all airlines. United, you need to start thinking like a customer.\", \"united airlines So many issues with United. My 18 year old daughter booked a flight via United. This was her first solo flight. Her flight into ORD was an hour delayed for departure into SFO, which threw off all her connections. United's solution? To reroute her to Seattle and offer no hotel vouchers, or meal vouchers, so that she was forced to sleep in the airport from 1:15 am to 8am. They also made her check her bag in GSP, not because of size or weight, but because of her tight connecting flight in SFO (which she was unable to make due to the hour delay in ORD) So, all for $551, plus $25 bag fee, plus anxiety and stress for a first time, solo traveler. And to add even more insult, her bag won't even arrive when she does! She has to wait an entire day for her bag to arrive in RDM. We will wait to see how they respond, but given my part experience, it will probably be minimal - maybe a bag refund. But even that will be a stretch for this airline.\", 'united airlines Our family of five was traveling for a cruise. The flight was two hours late leaving San Francisco to Houston and two hours late on the return from Houston to San Francisco. Both times it was apparently due to maintenance. Both times other planes had to be brought in. In Houston, United has three terminals and yet, when no one is leaving their gate, there is nowhere to sit. We chose them because it was a non-stop flight, event though it would have been closer for us to leave out of San Jose. Lesson learned.', \"united airlines My wife and I had a horrible experience in a round-trip international flight with United Airlines. In our departure flight, when we wanted to check in at SFO, United staff told us that United would not deliver our baggage in our final destination and we would need to pick up our baggage in our second stop, Dubai. When we tried to pick up our baggage in Dubai, airport staff said UAE visa is required to go to baggage claim area and since we did not have UAE visa, they didn't allow us to pick up our baggage. After lots of negotiations and asking several people for advice, we found out that we would need to pay $84 to transfer our baggage. Our flight back to US was supposed to be operated by Austrian Airlines (we bought the round-trip ticket from United) with 2 stops in Vienna and Zurich. When we went to airport, Austrian Airlines staff didn't allow us to check in. They said that flight from Vienna to Zurich is a domestic flight in European Union and would require Schengen Visa. So, we had to reschedule our flight with Lufthansa, we paid $1000 and could get another flight for 2 days later. If United had informed us about those issues when we bought the ticket or even at the airport, none of those problems would have happened. I asked United to reimburse us for all those extra costs but they only offered us two $150 flight certificates, which are basically useless, most of the time United tickets are more expensive than other flights and those $150 dollar certificates hardly have $20 cash value each. They donâ€™t even have a phone number for complaints. The only way you can contact them for complaints, is email or voicemail. I think they have so many complaints that they cannot handle, so they have decided to just offer $150 to $200 to anyone who fills out a complaint instead of hearing the details and trying to improve their customer service. Be very careful when you fly with United. Check all the single details of your trip, take some food with you in long flights and do not expect them to answer their phone. The moment you pay for the ticket, you are on your own.\", \"united airlines I am a frequent flyer and somehow have managed to avoid flying with United Airlines until this last trip, only now do I realise how lucky I have been. Simply the worst airline I have flown with. This was a (5 flight) short vacation and each of the five United flights were overbooked so sitting near your family was never an option so it was inappropriate to share with the unfamiliar passengers beside me how rude the cabin staff were. United managed to add to our itinerary a 12 hour delay due to malfunctioning aircraft, included in this delay were a few hours on that unbearably hot and uncomfortable plane, without even a drink being offered, before being ushered back to the gate now completely void of any United Airline staff and therefore information. A $15 food voucher (1 airport priced sandwich) was the compensation for the day lost from the vacation and $100's lost in missed excursions. We were told that customer services would have a full record of the events and on our return we should discuss the possibility of an upgrade on our longest return flight. At the customer service desk at Newark they said that they had no details of our journey and couldn't / wouldn't look into it but suggested phoning customer services, remember that we were standing at the customer services desk!

Flew from Seattle to Puerto Rico, I\\'d never flown domestic business and I\\'ve since learned it\\'s not worth it from all reviews (to put it mildly). It started with the lounge. It was about 6.30 pm when I got there, and I had run out of the house without dinner, assuming I could get some snacks in the lounge and dinner on the plane. The lounge had about 6 crackers scattered in a bowl, a couple of cut up strips of bell pepper, and 4 warm cheese cubes. When I asked the bartender if they had some more crackers, or maybe even some cheese and cold cuts (the empty dishes had little leftover traces of what appeared to be cold cuts), I was told \"what was out there was what was there\". I took my 6 crackers and 4 strips of bell pepper and went to log on to the WiFi. It wouldn\\'t accept the password and when I finally got logged on it was dial-up slow. When I got to my seat on the plane (which wasn\\'t terrible, but wasn\\'t anything near what I was expecting, again, I\\'d only used business for international flights previously), I was disgusted the find the middle console/arm rest covered in crumbs and something sticky. I was annoyed at this point so I took a picture and posted it on their Facebook, and someone did reply within an hour or so, but all they did was ask for the flight number, there was never any other follow up. It would have been nice just to get a quick, sorry about that reply. The service was ok, the food was better that what you\\'d get from economy, but that\\'s about it. Coming back was also less than smooth. I understand Newark is a busy airport, but the gates were awful. They changed gates at the last minute and their app didn\\'t update, so when I left the lounge I started walking to where the app said they gate was. I was about halfway there when I saw a screen that listed the correct gate and had to backtrack. I guess the fault in that was mine because I should have, as they say \"trust[ed] but verify[ed]\" instead of assuming the app would have some sort of auto-updating feature. They were boarding groups 1 and 2 with the business class group, so the line was long and not pleasant (though nowhere near as long or chaotic as group 3/4/5 and 6/7 lines - they didnt have dividers or anything, so the lines were mixed together and people were squabbling with other people who walked up to what they assumed was the end of the line and wasnt). All in all, compared to the foreign airlines I\\'ve used, United\\'s standards were sadly lacking and showed their age/indifference.', 'united airlines I flew from Denver to Houston with United Airlines in a cast with crutches and was left in a seat at the rear of the plane. No wheelchair offered. It was only after I was still sitting there that they thought some help was in order. I was taken by cart to my connecting gate and when I asked if these was a possibility for a restroom stop and a bottle of water I was ignored. The driver dropped me by a wheelchair and I had to ask if he could please put my bag on my lap. Still needing the facilities, I pushed my wheelchair forward two feet and crutched to it until I made it to the restroom. A passer by assisted me with getting a bottle of water. I am so disappointed and will never book again. I informed the gate person of the lack of help and also the first flight attendent in the plane. No apologies. So, here I sit in row 31 wondering what awaits me at the end of this leg.', \"united airlines United's staff professional and efficient. There was no trouble making connections with Las Vegas to State College PA via Chicago flights, even given poor weather and the need to de-ice. The cabins on all of their planes however, remain cramped and they are almost always full. This is an industry-wide problem, and it isn't any better on any of United's competitors. My primary complaint is United's Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment services - and this is limited only to their Boeing aircraft. The outbound part of my trip was on an Airbus A320. There are never any connectivity issues, and those planes have a nice library of TV shows and movies to stream over my tablet. The Boeing portion of their fleet, however, is a WiFi disaster. It was so bad on that leg of the trip the flight crew had to do the safety announcement themselves rather than rely on the video that United probably spent millions of dollars producing. If you're able to connect at all on the Boeing planes, the connection is unreliable. United would like you to pay for this service, too. Just don't. It's a rip off. United really needs to end their relationship with Direct TV, and switch their entire fleet over to the system on the Airbus planes. Bring a tablet, download a couple movies on it. It's the only way you'll be able to watch something on their Boeing fleet. Beyond the entertainment issue, the cramped cabins that all the airlines have, and the standard hassle with TSA, United is still a good bet. They go places a lot of the other carriers just don't. The crews are generally friendly, and their airfares are competitive. Oh, and there were really unusual little complimentary snack packages they were handing out. Not the typical nuts or chips. They were surprisingly tasty. Too bad they were so small.\", 'united airlines Was dreading flying with United Airlines as reviews were not encouraging. However I was pleasantly surprised on my flights from Birmingham to Las Vegas via Newark. The crew were friendly and the flights were all on time. On three out of four legs we had three seats between two, which does improve a flight (although not enough to pay for the extra seat). Admittedly the food was not good, but the house wine and beer were fine. Much better experience than I had anticipated.', 'united airlines 8th & 9th January 2016, LAX to MEL, United Airlines flight 98, Aircraft 789. Over Dec to January I flew with United Airlines on four flights in total spending over $3,500. I was scheduled to return home to Australia on the 8th of January, which turned into the 9th of January. People had boarded the flight ready to fly to Australia, little did they know they werenâ€™t going to be on the plane for a further 24 hrs. After further mechanical delays (four hours later) to determine if the plane was fit to fly. United decided to cancel my flight to Melbourne. During this whole ordeal I was told different information from United Staff. We were accommodated for in terms of accommodation for the night, and were handed vouchers. The problem was United Staff were adamant that you could use the vouchers anywhere, but in reality when you showed people these vouchers they would not accept them. I had to pay for the extra day over in LAX out of my pocket. Originally I had a premium economy aisle seat on the first flight on the 8th January, on the return flight I received a faulty seat at the back of the plane in economy. I had been told at the service desk that my seating would not be downgraded. Not only was my seat downgraded, the seat I received was faulty. After talking to United staff on the plane, to my surprise staff didnâ€™t try to accommodate myself. This 24 hour delay resulted in me missing a day of work. The experience I received was below a budget airline, and can confidently say I would never recommend or fly with United Airlines again.', 'united airlines San Francisco to London with United Airlines. When I checked in on-line the flight appeared to be only half full in BusinessFirst. Once at the gate I saw that all 14 of the upgrade requests had been accepted. The cabin was now completely full with a resulting slowness in the service and delay in lights out for sleeping. The seat itself coverts into lie flat but does not seem to be much wider than the economy class seat as they are arranged 8 abreast. Feet have to be put into quite a narrow slot that makes it difficult to turn over. A lot of the flight entertainment movies were old James Bond titles. The evening meal was OK but nothing more than that. I am not sure why they feel offering ice cream for dessert is something special. Unlike some airlines there was a full hot breakfast. Arrived a few minutes early but then had a very long walk to immigration.', \"united airlines San Francisco to Vancouver with United Airlines. My flight time was changed without any notification to me. At check in the staff were so incompetent that by the time they worked out my booking, the flight was closed by 5 mins. The manager and the staff did not try and help get me on the flight. The manager then stated it was my fault for not checking that my flight hadn't changed. He said it was not United's policy to notify people when the flights change, in this case, bringing it forward 1 hour. They could not then get me another direct flight, so now instead of being in Vancouver at 10am it'll be closer to 4pm. So the plane was older than me, and once we are all on board they say a seat is broken and we all need to get off so they can fix it. The worst bit was the lack of empathy and customer service.\", \"united airlines Minneapolis to Los Angeles via Denver. United Airlines screwed up our family vacation and cost me $1400.00. As a relatively frequent traveler taking several flights a year I have picked my flights based on cost and convenient times and dates regardless of airline. After my recent experience with United, I will no longer book United flights. Our family traveled to Los Angeles for New Years Eve and the Rose Bowl. My boys who both had recently started new jobs could only get a limited amount of time off so I flew them out on New Years Eve to meet us for a long weekend. On a night with perfect weather conditions their flight from Minneapolis to Denver was delayed due to mechanical problems and they missed their connecting flight to Los Angeles by a few minutes. They called me very distressed because the United agent told them they couldn't fly them to Los aneles until January 2, the day they had to return home. Our family then went on line and found an Amercan flight that would get them to Los Angeles in time to get to the Rose Bowl game on New Years. In the aftermath I contacted United costumer service, The person I told my story to on the phone said â€œThats unfortunate we have an agreement with American and should have been able to get you on that flight.â€\\x9d They told me how to online apply for compensation, so I submitted my claim. The person who responded to my claim said they could refund the unused portion of the ticket to Los Angeles but they could not refund the flight we had purchased on our own. So in summary on the day of the flight United was unable to get my boys where they were supposed to and said they couldn't get them there for 2 days. We were able to find a flight that salvaged part of the trip on an airline United had access to. Then they refused to reimburse me for booking the flight they should have found themselves. I am extremely disappointed in Uniteds lack of effort in trying to get my boys where they were scheduled to be. I am also extremely disappointed in their customer service response to my request for fair compensation.\", \"united airlines When I looked at this United Airlines flight this morning it was pretty empty which always worries me. The airlines do not like this. Sure enough, when I arrived I saw that they added additional flights from other airlines to this one to fill it up. Delayed due to aircraft arrival they said. First delay was 45min, then an additional 45 mins. They told us it was due to severe weather in Eugene, OR for this second delay. I looked it up, no delays in that area at all, no weather. Then came the second delay, another 45mins! And I checked the seating chart, now almost full. Just another episode of the airlines not caring about anyone else's schedules but their own. Last month they outright canceled my husbands early fight sometime middle of the night from a smaller airport. It was not full either and I'm sure they couldn't do this same trick due to location. No other flights available either. I will be looking at other airlines but do not have much faith in any these days.\", 'united airlines Manchester to Newark return with United Airlines, and I was very disappointed with this airline. On the outbound flight staff were grumpy, food was processed, the best part was cheese and crackers. We had a morning flight on the way to Newark and were served pasta for breakfast. On the return flight we was served dinner at 9pm USA time and 2am UK time. The lights in the cabin were left on until 11pm USA time (4am UK time), and were turned back on 2 hours later. I would have thought long haul flights would be accustomed to helping their passengers by promoting sleep when changing over time zones! Again, the food was horrible on the return flight, I will not fly this airline again.', \"united airlines I had 3 cancelled flights in one round trip with United Airlines from Wichita to Providence via Chicago. Ground staff were not well trained and couldn't really help to appropriately re-book my flight. When the first flight was canceled on my outgoing flight the next option would have been to either fly two days later from the same airport or 1 day later from another airport (which cost me $100 to get to). On my return journey, the first flight was cancelled again. They tried to book me onto a Delta flight but didn't manager to transfer my passenger information, so I missed the flight. They then rebooked me onto a 12 hours trip from Kansas to Texas to NYC to Rhode Island (original trip time was 6 hours). I had a 4 hours layover in Houston, TX when I went to the United Airlines service desk to ask for any shorter options. They told me that I wasn't even on my next flight anymore because the NYC to Rhode Island flight was cancelled. Nobody told me that, I just found out by accident. They finally put me on a direct flight from Houston to Boston (which meant another $100 bill for the taxi to Rhode Island. Very poor customer service.\", 'united airlines Washington DC to San Francisco, and United Airlines is the worst airline I have flown. No customer service on the ground or in the air. Five hour flight - no audiovisual entertainment! The two flights I have flown with United we were told at the time of boarding that the flight was overbooked. On this flight our seat numbers were designated xxx. Everyone except us and two other customers had seat numbers it seemed. They said we booked very late (7 weeks prior!). I refused all offers until eventually they relented and a few customers took up offers of $400 and a re-scheduled flight. On the plane it was evident that there were empty seats (premium and business) - so they would rather fly with empty seats and pay people not to fly!', \"united airlines I was not impressed with United. I flew from Ho Chi Minh City to Providence with a layover in Hong Kong. I ended up having a delay in Hong Kong for over 4 hours. We were supposed to leave at 11.15am but were told it wouldn't be until 5.15pm - but then we suddenly boarded at 3.15pm without the departures board changing from 5.15pm. The crew was grumpy and on several occasions one of the stewards raised his voice in annoyance at an older man who spoke Chinese and was having trouble with his entertainment system. My inflight entertainment was unresponsive unless I jabbed very hard at the screen (which I wasn't going to do because there was someone sitting in front of me trying to sleep). They restarted the system but it did not help. And I was told condescendingly that I was just pressing too many time and the screen was freezing. I was purposely pressing the touchscreen slowly once and waiting and waiting. But they couldn't be bothered to assist me. Seats were uncomfortable. I did not like the food. Usually I like airline food. The chicken rice dish was watery and goopy. I definitely would not recommend flying United Airlines.\", 'united airlines Our Atlanta to Chicago United Airlines flight was cancelled but we were not notified until we got to the airpport. It had been cancelled hours before. The airline made no effort to assist us with another flight. We had to drag it out of them. We were offered a flight late the next day which would not work for us. We ended up flying to another destination and arranged ground transportation home at added time and expense. We were denied any compensation other than a reduced fee on booking yet another flight with them. So give them more money in exchange for a mythical $50 fee reduction. This is a second class airline with rotten customer service!', 'united airlines Austin to Calgary via Houston with United Airlines. First flight was only a short hop but was quite good, flight on time departure and early arrival which assisted the connection. Second flight was longer and meal served. Meal choices not to my taste but my wife said her selection was one of the better meals she has had on airline. Direct TV offered.', \"united airlines United Airlines cancelled my Seattle to Chicago flight due to imaginary weather. I don't know the reason reason for cancelling my flight, maybe another flight that was more full had mechanical problems, what I do know is that no other airlines were having any trouble getting into SEA from ORD, in fact no other airlines were having any trouble getting anywhere that day (2nd January 2016). I was forced to pay for a hotel, I was very disappointed in their lack of honesty, and I will not fly United again.\", 'united airlines Louisville to Lihue. My first time flying with United and it was the worst experience ever. Our flight delayed and no staff was around to help answer or inform us the flight status. Later on after I landed in Lihue I went through my messages and noticed there was an email notification about the flight change. I guess electronic messages is the new customer services? I had a 5hr flight from SDF to Denver and 7hrs flight from Denver to Lihue. The flight attendant showed up maybe twice for us to order our cold, horrible meal. No one else showed up after that to even collect the trash. Nor even to offer water. Myself and a lot of the passengers had to take our own trash to the bathroom. Fast forward to today - I had to extend my stay and I was told it will cost me a total of $600-$900 to change it. I paid $1200 for a round trip ticket and they are going to charge me $700 for fare differences and $200 change fee - and the funny part is that I can go and book the exact flight online for $345.00. It blows my mind on how this monkey business situation is operated. Now, I just booked my return ticket back with Alaska Airlines.', \"united airlines San Juan to Houston. I've flown with a variety of airlines and I would have to say United Airlines was probably the worst. No free flight entertainment (usually atleast one movie will be free to watch on other airlines), no free snacks on a 5 hour flight, and the worst part of all was the fact you had to pay to watch the flight tracker! Who does that?\", 'united airlines I was on one of the many cancelled flights due to the big storm on the east coast of the United States in January 2016. This is a \"best of times/worst of times\" review about that experience with United Airlines from New Delhi, India to Newark. The bad side was that the United desk in New Delhi was very late in informing us of the cancellation. I, and many others, had cleared immigration/security before United told us. My wife, who was in the US, told me later she knew the flight was cancelled long before I did by watching the United website. This late notice left us stuck in the secure area. We had a long (2+ hours) wait before the staff was able to get us out of that area. The good side was the once United got organized they were very supportive in providing us free room and board in a 5 star hotel for as long as we needed. They provided comfortable transportation to and from the airport and the staff did everything they could to assist us.', 'united airlines What a disappointment. I regularly take United Airlines flight from Eugene to San Diego which connects in San Francisco. Typically there is only about 15 minutes to get to the connecting flight in SF before the plane takes off. Today, my dad took this same flight and has been waiting in the SF airport for 8 hours because the plane from Eugene was a few minutes late and the flight to San Diego left without him. Since United does not offer vouchers for \"weather related delays,\" my dad was pushed behind about 20 other people on standby to catch another flight to SD, even though he was one of the first people to be placed on standby because the other people apparently paid more for their tickets. What a joke! After not being able to catch 4 more flights out of SFO, he is still stranded. This trip was a gift for my dad to come and see me and now he has had to spend most of it sitting in SFO airport, watching other people on standby get on flights to SD before him because they paid more for their ticket. Why can\\'t United Airlines partner with a \"sister\" airline, to accommodate these kinds of absurd incidents where their guests are left stranded at the airport? Also, why would United regularly plan for only 15 minutes to catch a connecting flight in San Francisco of all places - an airport that is famous for weather related issues? Used to be my favorite airline but after this fiasco, I\\'m so over them.', \"united airlines San Francisco to Dallas, and United Airlines is an absolute joke of an airline with no idea about customer service. Uncomfortable seats and demotivated staff. Arrived at the gate 14 minutes before the scheduled departure after having checked in, and my ticket had already been given to a staff member on standby. If you don't board your United flight 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure you risk losing your seat to United staff members or someone else on standby. Flight was full and had to spend an extra night in San Francisco. Staff was unapologetic. Will not fly United again.\", 'united airlines Portland to KeÄ\\x81hole. I live in a United Airlines family. My grandfather worked for UA for 60 years. My family has stayed true to United ever since. No matter how much money we would save by flying with other airlines, we never do. It\\'s for this reason that I take it so personally that United Airlines customer service has gotten so poor. 6 weeks ago I had to reschedule a flight due to a medical emergency. Rescheduling was no problem, and they handled the situation very quickly for me. I was supposed to receive a refund 10 days later. It never came. I\\'ve tried calling the past 2 days. Yesterday. Although I was on the line before closing time, as soon as closing time hit my call was dropped. Today, I waiting for 18 minutes just to have a rep \"transfer\" me to a dead line that said \"your call cannot be completed as dialed. Goodbye.\" I\\'m now calling back a third time. This matter could be handled so simply if only the telephone customer service agents cared. I will not waste my time or money flying with United again, I just don\\'t have the patience anymore.', 'united airlines Phoenix to Vancouver, and United Airlines is the most unorganized, unfriendly airline I have ever flown with. They really need to focus on hiring friendlier and more helpful staff. From check-in, to getting on the plane, to the young lady serving us on the plane, they all had attitude and were extremely rude.', \"united airlines United Airlines is such a disorganized company, it would be comedic if I wasn't stuck at their gate. They've managed to ruin my flights twice in one trip. When laying over in Denver to Colorado Springs, they forgot our flight attendant at another airport! After they couldn't find a replacement, they tried sending another plane to fetch us. Being delayed every hour on the hour (was only supposed to be a 30min flight), they cancelled our flight at 1230am, due to engine failure, with no compensation. An Air Force pilot was so generous to have stood up and announced he had rented a car to drive to COS and had three empty seats. He was not affiliated to UA, in any way, and had no obligation to us. This moment, I am on my way back to NJ, laying over in Chicago, and our flight has been delayed 2hrs, so far. Apparently, our plane needed maintenance and has been kept in the hangar. How can this happen twice in one trip? All I want is to get home safe and on time. Our new plane has just arrived at the gate, unlikely to leave even at the new delayed time, and the engines are smoking. I just want to leave this airport, already. This is the worst traveling experience in my life and I used to fly with American Airlines. So, to anyone planning a trip in the future, just pay the few extra dollars for Delta. It would be well worth it. Also, please refrain from putting objects in the overhead compartment that will fit under the chair in front of you. People with real carry ons need the space for the one compact bag with everything we brought.\", 'united airlines Bogota to Houston. Very disappointed in the level of service provided by United Airlines both into and out of Bogota. Into Bogota, the flight was delayed several hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight within Colombia. The United Airlines office in the Bogota airport was hard to find and the United staff were not helpful to deal with headaches caused by their airline. Similar on return flight, not very helpful and disputed office hours posted on the office door in the Bogota airport, they were nowhere to be found. My concern was the possibility of missing my connecting flight in the US due to their delays and the short layover they booked in Houston. Again, no one cared or tried to be helpful. And missed flight, lost baggage and standing in another huge line trying to get things figured out! Will never recommend United Airlines.', \"united airlines I flew from Chicago to San Francisco on one of United Airlines many daily flights between the two hubs. It was a typical United flight: delayed by an hour, no sense of urgency as plane was being boarded. Seat comfort was fine. My power outlet couldn't hold a plug without it falling out constantly, which made doing work difficult. A few things I did enjoy : pretty good customer service, effective internet that priced by the hour (which was a bargain for me, because I only needed to use it for a couple of hours).\", \"united airlines Houston to Birmingham via Newark with United Airlines, and not what I expected at all.I paid for upgrade to premium economy, not actually sure it was any different to economy. There was a little extra legroom but apart from that I didn't see anything different. I have been on many flights as travel a lot with work and have to say most economy seats I have had in the past have been even better than this. All seats seemed very old and could have done with a good clean! The service wasn't particularly bad but I wouldn't say it was good either. If I have a choice I won't be flying with them again. Lufthansa premium economy is miles above United, I am so shocked by the difference!\", 'united airlines I took UA742 from Palm Springs to San Francisco. The 1hr 45 mins flight ended up taking 3 hours due to general incompetence from United. Several issues occurred. There was an unannounced gate change that was never updated in United\\'s system. The only indication that we were boarding at a different gate was a paper sign hung by the new gate that said \"SF.\" This resulted in several passengers boarding the plane late because they were at the wrong gate. Flight attendants allowed passengers to continue trading seats even after the flight was ready to depart. I understand trying to accommodate families that want to sit together, but once the plane is loaded we should have gotten on the road! Gate agents never asked anyone to gate check, but then (predictably) there wasn\\'t enough overhead space for everyone\\'s bag, so several passengers had to exit the plane, gate check, and re-board, which contributed to the flight delay. The flight itself was alright, but it was just ridiculous how poorly managed the boarding process was.', \"united airlines Philadelphia to San Francisco, and United Airlines boarding system is archaic and ridiculous. Don't pick an aisle seat or you will end up getting on last and there will be no overhead space for your bag. When I was boarding, the Group 3, 4 and 5 lines were lined up for a long time since no one pays attention to this system knowing that they're going to get screwed if they try to get a bag in the overhead. I was a 5 and when our turn came, they suddenly announced that everyone (1/5 of the passengers) had to check their carry on bags at the counter because there was no overhead space available which caused complete chaos. After going through security and always getting x-rayed and patted down for no reason, facing this boarding madness feels like torture not to mention the long flight ahead. I did pay for the extra leg room but you get no priority boarding for that - you're just like the people who pay nothing extra. The crew look miserable and I can't say I blame them and the passengers seem sullen and depressed after the regimen they've been through. If companies like United Airlines want to encourage repeat business, they're going to have to realize that you can't treat people like animals and sometimes you might want to give them something to comfort their stress in flying - not even peanuts - they're so cheap. Then I had to find my bag in the carousel - that took another 45 minutes.\", 'united airlines Seattle to Dallas via Denver. We were scheduled to leave at 5:15 am, and have a one hour layover in Denver. We boarded on time, and then just sat for about an hour, while mechanics retrieved paperwork for seat repairs. Apparently the paperwork was at the other end of the airport. I don\\'t know why it wasn\\'t there before the flight. During our \"wait\", we were offered drinks soon after boarding, and then for the rest of the hour, flight attendants spent their time in the galley, laughing, having a good old time. Not once did anyone check on passengers, at least in the front of the aircraft. On our return trip, which went from Dallas to Chicago, when meals were brought to us, first my son, who doesn\\'t drink, was served a beer, then was served the wrong meal. The attendant was very apologetic, and was really nice, but this seems to be an ongoing problem with United. Service is definitely lacking. As far as the aircraft, they are aging planes, with little in ammenities, like wi-fi, or even power outlets for cels, or laptops. I know these problems seem petty, but I usually fly in first class,and have come to expect better service for the extra money that it cost, but this didn\\'t even come close to other airlines.', \"united airlines My husband injured his back the night before our United Airlines trip from Boston to Maui. We arrived at the airport with him in a wheelchair. We were ushered to the gate by an airport representative - all was well. We had forgotten we booked exit row seats and the gate agents didn't realize the issue until we were boarding. We were in row 7, and I completely understand that, with my husband's injury, we could not remain in the exit row. What I am taking issue with is the manner in which the agents handled moving us. They made an announcement over the PA and offered our seats to the entire plane. All they asked was that 2 people sitting together exchange seats with us. We paid over $100 each to be in those seats and, at most, the seats should have been offered to other passengers in EconomyPlus seating. Instead, the PA announcement caused mayhem at the gate with many people rushing the counter. Our seats were exchanged for two seats in row 27. So, my husband was rolled to the plane in a wheelchair and then had to almost crawl to row 27. They could have offered the seats to passengers in row 8, for example - at least for starters. Seems as though this would make the ADA shiver. Once the agents realized we had to be moved out of the exit row, we became an annoyance to them. This is a huge fail on the part of United. To add insult to injury, once everyone was onboard, an announcement about the availability of economy seats was made! So, I hit the flight attendant call button, explained what happened and was told we could not move - that there really weren't any seats.\", 'united airlines I decided to start flying a lot more than I had before in the past and I chose United Airlines due to their credit card rewards and prices of the flights. I will give credit for one thing, the mobile app is amazing and saves a lot of time. I have been on quite a few flights and had some minor complaints but nothing big enough for me to ever voice or make me want to change airlines. Well, that has changed. I flew with United Airlines from Little Rock to Dallas to San Diego to San Francisco to Las Vegas to Houston and back to Little Rock this month. On my flight to Vegas I noticed there were a ton of extra seats in the front, the flight might\\'ve been half full at most. So I asked the flight attendant before boarding if I was able to move up seeing as I flew with often and I wasn\\'t feeling well. She flat out lied to me and said \"those seats are reserved for employees tonight\". I had absolutely no problem with that and told her I completely understood. Well, I was seated by 2 men on the flight to Vegas and at take off all of those seats were empty. That flight attendant was onboard serving everyone but the other seats that were supposedly \"taken by employees\" weren\\'t actually taken. I was appalled that she had the adauctity to lie to my face. Also, another problem is the $75 same day change fee. I changed my flight that day to a later departure time and it cost me $75 to do that even though the flight wasn\\'t even close to full. Needless to say, I\\'m changing airlines and do not plan on flying with United again. Southwest is doing it right with their no change fee, might want to look into that.', 'united airlines Chicago to Manila. Out of all the flights I have taken from the United States to Manila, United Airlines is the worse I have taken.

I will not ever go through United Airlines again.', \"united airlines Indianapolis to Los Angeles via Houston. I had to call to make my reservations, because the website couldn't make them for me (on the phone for 45mins). I had requested the travelers insurance when I booked, and the agent failed to apply it as requested. If you fly United I highly recommend getting the travelers insurance!! I had to call back, the person that made my reservations, entered my lastname as both my first and last name (another 45 mins on the phone). Then my original booking got changed without notification. I was originally to be routed thru Houston and got routed to Dulles in DC. Then my flight got cancelled while I was in DC, due to weather, which is understandable. The customer service was a very pathetic attempt at customer service. I waited in line for over 2 hours, and there were only 25 people in line in front of me. I was told that there were no flights out to L.A. til 2 days later and that United would pay for 3/4 of a 200+ a night hotel, that was their hotel of choice, I was told they wouldn't pay for anything else. After telling them that was not acceptable, and fly me back home, the person next to her found a flight to LAX for a person behind me in line and I was still stuck in DC. The customer service agent then found a flight out to San Francisco, so I took that flight, because I wanted out of the airport after being there all day. Since San Francisco was not my original destination city, I had to take a Greyhound from San Francisco to Los Angeles. I lost 2 complete days due to travel, between cancellation and not getting a correct flight. This also caused for more money out of pocket to get me to the correct location. I don't understand how they hadn't planned for something, since the plane was coming from Chicago, and it is winter. I was just very disappointed with my whole experience with United. Seating was not designed for people of taller stature, I am 6 foot tall with an athletic build, and could not sit comfortably on any of my flights. My return trip was not as bad, but flying coast to coast and then back to the midwest seems like a waste, especially since United's hub city is Chicago.\", 'united airlines Once again United Airlines messes up, travelling from Los Angeles to San Diego.

When we got to Santa Fee, we 'lost' our checked-in box of edible stuff! We had to spend 2 days tracking the package, and American Airlines was the replacement airline to get our package from Denver to Santa Fe. SO it was an American Airlines employee who went beyond her duty to take copious notes and actually contacted the tracking office in Santa Fee. All Lost Luggage calls to the tracking office (outsourced as usual and the agents were not able to help us except to say they could only do their best) produced no results. We travelled on Wednesday December 16 and finally got the package on Friday December 18 by which time some of the food stuff had gone off. Then on our return flight on January 8, 2016, our flights were all delayed, starting from Santa Fee and at Denver, it was a nightmare for my mother and I. She needed wheelchair assistance and we had to request for it twice because the gates got changed, like 5 minutes we were dumped at the first gate. At the second gate, we were advised on the Departure screens that the gate was now somewhere else, even further from the original gate. In the end, my mother got fed up and walked to the last gate where we finally got a rep who was very professional and patient. The information on the Departure screen was confusing as both United and Air Canada were shown to be departing at the same gate but with 5 minutes difference. The flight was delayed by 4 hours and instead of getting into Toronto at a reasonable hour of 10.30 pm on Jan 8, we only got home at 3 am! We have determined not to fly United Airlines any more as this experience has left a sour note.\", 'united airlines Pleasantly surprised at how well this Los Angeles to Melbourne flight was, given the length (15 hours) and the reputation of United Airlines. The Boeing 787-9 we flew in was a new aircraft, the cabin does feel airier, with larger windows, and improved lighting. The cabin crew on this flight was a mix bag of very senior flight attendants who were quite stand off-ish, to younger flight attendants who were very nice, attentive and friendly. United has upped its game in catering for the Business First cabin and it shows. Portions were plentiful, wines good, and choices good. The mid-flight snacks left on the credenza at the forward most section of the cabin and in the mid-Business cabin galley were basic and not great, but not an issue, given the large dinner service. Breakfast was served 90 minutes out of Melbourne. Flight departed on time and arrived 30-35 minutes ahead of schedule. If United can replicate the service and feel of the 787-9 to its other aircraft cabins on long haul flights, then it might have turned a corner. The LAX terminal it operates from is dingy, dirty, and has zero to offer in terms of comfort. It is supposed to be upgraded. Not soon enough. WIFI on board the plane, at $19.99 is a relative bargain and worked extremely reliably, for the entire duration of the flight. Sleep quality also quite decent.', 'united airlines My wife and I booked a flight on United Airlines from Seattle to San Antonio to attend our sonâ€™s graduation from Air force Basic Military Training. When we got to Denver to change planes, the nightmare began. We were stranded. United didnâ€™t have a cockpit crew (which they described as operational difficulties) and all other flights were already overbooked. We received text messages about every half hour with a new update. This took place for 7 hours and finally at 4pm, United cancelled the flight. Hours later we got an e-mail saying they booked us on a flight the next day, leaving us to miss our sonâ€™s graduation. So at that point, we might as well of gone home. Determined not to miss it, we booked a rental car and planned to drive all night to make it. Thankfully my wife found a flight on Southwest and we made it in time. Today I received an e-mail saying we would be receiving a $150.00 credit for each of us to use on a future flight, with United of course. A nice gesture, but if it hadnâ€™t cost me $522.63 (not to mention approximately 14 hours) to fly from Seattle to San Antonio, I could buy my own airline tickets. Very disappointing customer service.', 'united airlines I was flying from Indianapolis to Newark this morning and got caught behind a slow moving semi after the first large snowfall at home. Needless to say, I was rather late getting to the airport for my morning flight. Upon checking in the computer stated that I was too late to check my bags. The two United Airlines agents helped me get my boarding pass quickly and check my baggage regardless. I was sprinting towards the gate and had dropped my boarding pass. The employee working at the gate waved me on and told me my seat number in a friendly manner. I arrived in Newark and my bags made it on the plane. I was so thrilled with the customer service I received and the attitude of the employees.', 'united airlines I was pleasantly surprised with United Airlines performance on my trip from Honolulu to Las Vegas via San Francisco. I heard rumors which almost got me to book with a different airline, but the price was good enough to push on. Once I boarded the aircraft there was personal TV touch-screens on the back of each seat, I watched a few movies over the period of the 6 hour flight and enjoyed a decent meal, for plane food. Overall I would fly this airline again, very comfortable.', \"united airlines United Airlines from Seattle to Washington DCA. I didn't know until the night before my flight that I couldn't bring a carry-on item (I had a backpack and a laptop bag, nothing bulky). I was rushing to the airport. Thought I could just pay a small fee but at the desk I believe the cost was $50. $50 for a laptop bag?! I ended up barely shoving the laptop bag into my backpack which was bulging and jammed it under my seat, making it impossible to open the backpack. All the while, the overhead space was almost empty and gone to waste. As soon as I sat down, I heard 3+ announcements about ensuring personal items fit under the seat in front of you, which was obnoxious and draconian. Seats were mediocre in terms of comfort. Then, I began watching the little TV screen. But 30 minutes in, the show I was watching froze and I was asked to pay to continue watching (well, that's lovely). And lastly, there was no complimentary beverage. Not even free waters were offered (evidently you had to specifically ask for a cup of water if need be). Absolute worst airline I have flown with. Only benefit was that it was slightly cheaper than other airlines, but still not worth it.\", \"united airlines San Francisco to Chicago. When you pay $95 annually for a Mileage Plus Explorer credit card, you're supposed to get one free checked bag for flights purchased using the Mileage Plus card. Don't believe it! When United changed the credit card number because that card was apparently compromised, United refused to allow one free checked bag, because the credit card we had at the airport did not match the card used to purchase the tickets (which had since been cancelled). It's a sneaky way for United to get an extra $50, but it's also a clear violation of its policy.\", 'united airlines United Airlines from London to Orlando return via Washington Dulles. Flight from London was prompt, seats allocated at check in. On getting to Washington, our flight to Orlando was delayed by 5 hours! Unbelievable. To add insult to the injury, the airline did not even announce the reason nor did they apologise. Rather, the announcement was for volunteers to check in their hand luggage as the plane was completely overbooked. They also requested for volunteers who would offer up their seat since they oversold ticket! The flight back from Orlando was much more horrible, flight was delayed from MCO and this almost impacted on the connecting flight at Washington. No seats were allocated at check in, we had to wait and wait as they kept increasing the duration of the delay of the first leg of my journey. Went to the customer service who didnâ€™t deem it fit to apologise, but said there should still be 40 mins for the connection and she canâ€™t promise there wonâ€™t be any further delays. Plane arrived eventually and we now fell on another queue at the boarding gate to get checked in for seat allocation. This delayed the flight much longer. So in all, we had to thrash the first boarding pass given at check in without seats, and got another boarding pass by the boarding gate. On landing at Washington, we had to race out of the aircraft and onto the other gate as there was no plan for the plane to wait and we couldnâ€™t afford to miss the flight as there was no other flight to London by United. And we still had to obtain another boarding pass with seats at the boarding gate. They were unable to sit us together because the attendant said she has been calling our names and we were not there. â€˜How would we be there when our first leg was delayed?â€™ was my question, she works with United Airlines and should have seen that the first aircraft hadnâ€™t arrived. So she almost gave our seats out if not that we were lucky to have reached the boarding gate within the few minutes prior to departure. With the horrible customer service experience, it was obvious those guys can leave us unattended if the plane had left for London. Flight attendants were horrible, attended to us as if they were told to go fight on the plane.', 'united airlines Got the early flight from Houston to San Jose, Costa Rica. Unfortunately, United Airlines does not offer special meals on First Class for some of its international flights, thus had to settle with some cold cut fruit and croissant for breakfast. Seats were alright, entertainment system was slightly below average. Service was good. Lounge was ill equipped in food and beverages for an international flight even though there was space to sit.', 'united airlines Panama Tocumen to Houston on United Airlines. Got into the 3:30 pm flight. Being a vegetarian, I did not get any food on a 4 hour flight flying in First Class, because of United\\'s policy of serving special meals only on select flights. Had to settle for the \"Tapas Box\". Did not have an entertainment system onboard and the seats were pretty old. Service was alright.', 'united airlines This review pertains to the Customer Service Reps at the United Airlines counter in Omaha. I realize that when a flight gets cancelled, the result is usually panic, confusion and frustration. However, being in customer service, I felt that there are other ways of alleviating the stress of their customers. While I was in line for over an hour, I watched one rep point and yell at the customers, one after another. I overhead her tell people that she\\'s heard it all, vacations, family gatherings, job responsibilities. She showed absolutely no empathy for any of the customers with their concerns. She didn\\'t refrain from just yelling at customers, she shared the same love with the employees. \"I only have 2 hands, you\\'ll have to figure it out on your own\". I felt so bad for everyone that experienced the \"help\" of this woman. This woman was the supervisor! It\\'s a wonder why the other employees didn\\'t feel the need to provide good customer service. It was simply, the flight is cancelled, we can get you there on the 2nd. That wasn\\'t an option for us and they didn\\'t provide any other solutions. Except another rep did suggest that we take the Amtrak down to Texas to catch our connecting flight. After hours of sitting in the airport trying to come up with a solution. We thought, how about driving to Denver? So we reluctantly went back to the counter to inquire on flights. Thankfully! We spoke with a male agent who was efficient and polite as possible, he booked our flight with a smile. It was reassuring that he took the time to explain to us the procedure. We left knowing that we had another option. Ironically, while waiting in line for our confirmation, I saw the supervisor walk by with a smile! However, the smile was because she was criticizing someone for duct taping the top of a water bottle. She was shaking her head and name calling. But from afar, one would think she actually liked her job. I am hesitant to ever fly United again. Constant cancellations and delays. According to Supervisor lady, it\\'s always due to weather. When in actuality, it was due to the fact that they had no crew due to the 8 hours wait time. If they weren\\'t short staffed, the weather excuse would not exist. And Supervisor lady would have to come up with another reason to point and yell at people.', 'united airlines United Airlines from Dubai to Dallas Fort-Worth via San Francisco. Checking in on a fully paid itinerary, I was told \"you have a seat but your children don\\'t\" - really? After 1 hour 45 minutes, we finally got boarding passes. The food from Dubai was less than good, but the main issue was the lack of food. 16 hours inflight, we were fed at hour one, and again at hour 14.5hrs - the \"snack\" offered was a tiny gross sandwich. We were totally unsatisfied by the offerings. Never have I been so hungry on a flight. To add to that, on the Washington to Dubai flight all food offerings inflight were spicy, and not a single pre-order meal was acceptable for a vegetarian child!', \"united airlines Seattle to Phoenix via San Francisco was just a horrific experience. United managed to screw up the most basic thing - scheduled 2 flights on the same gate with one aircraft. By the time they resolved the issue, I missed my connection in SFO and had to get the next flight which was 4 hours later. The worse thing is the United Airlne employees acted as if it was our problem to figure out how to get to our destination. It was just horribly frustrated. It was no better on the trip back to Seattle. The flight from Phoenix to SFO was 75 minutes late and the flight SFO to Seatte was 90 minutes late. The whole trip was a nightmare. I don't usually write review, but this unpleasant experience with UA was so significant that I thought I should share. It is no wonder that UA ranks the worst in customer satisfaction. And UA is proudly stand up to the reputation.\", \"united airlines Houston to Salt Lake City flight itself was alright. However, not only did United Airlines delay my checked baggage without telling me, baggage that I had specifically paid for, but then lied about the amount of time it would take to get that baggage back to me. I arrived at 5:00pm, the baggage didn't come until 9:30pm (I was told 8:00pm). Now it is 10:30am the next day and I still have yet to see my bag (I was told it would arrive 10:00pm at the latest). Needless to say, I won't be flying United again.\", \"united airlines United Airlines from Washington to Paris CDG. The plane was clean, and whilst I usually run into grumpy United Airlines staff, this flight had very friendly and polite crew. The major problem is that on an 8 hour flight, alcohol is not free, this is the first time I fly on a non-budget airline, actually one of the world's largest airlines, and alcohol is not free. I find it really cheap especially as alcohol helps me sleep in an economy seat on long flights.\", \"united airlines Flew return flights from Birmingham (UK) to Newark in December 2015 with United Airlines. Plane was 1 hour delayed leaving Birmingham due to issues with luggage being stored in the hold however no announcement was made by the crew until 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. The cabin crew on the way to Newark were rude and lacked basic customer service skills, even a smile and eye contact seemed to much. Rather than offer drinks, the trolley was swiftly marched down the aisle not stopping unless you caught their attention. My entertainment screen was also broken when I asked one of the female crew members to look if anything could be done I was told no and she wouldn't do anything. I understand it wasn't the end of the world as I had a book and my iPod but found her response unhelpful. Food was okay for airline standards and seats had a reasonable amount of legroom although we had upgraded to premium economy. On our return journey I was shocked at the rudeness of the staff at check in, we were using the self check-in system at Newark which I found clever and fast however the United Airlines attendant assisting passengers showed some of the poorest customer service I had ever seen, I'd advise not to ask for any help at this stage to anyone using the United Airlines Self Check in at Newark. The overnight flight back to Birmingham though was far more pleasant, it shows the difference a nice crew can make to your journey. Overall I wasn't massively impressed with United Airlines and probably would not use them again if it came to it. It's a shame the efforts of some staff members are overshadowed by others.\", 'united airlines We were booked on a 1230 (Wednesday) flight to Las Vegas to celebrate New Year - spent the night at the CLE airport to catch the 6:50 am flight. Checked flight status at 5 am - listed as \\'on time\\'. Went to the airport amidst the insanity of their construction and continued to check flight status - still \\'on time\\'. At 30 min. before the departure we got a text that the flight was \\'cancelled\\' - raced to Customer service along with every other passenger on the full flight, only to find no reps there yet - even though we were the second person in line, the rep said that \\'we can\\'t get you there til January 1st Friday\". And our return was Saturday - sounds phenomenal. Then she proceeded to tell us that the plan never arrived from its previous location----yet 30 min. before departure they were listing it as \\'on time\\'. Waiting on the \\'full refunds\\' they promised us - not holding my breath. As an aside, I have to laugh at the absurd sales pitches their FAs give regarding their \\'new improved IFE system\". If you like watching a movie on your cell phone or want to schlepp a laptop along, you\\'ll love it. If you don\\'t, you\\'re just out of luck. Our CLE-LAS flight stated it had NO IFE at all. This is shameful. United Airlines actions indicate they could not care less about their customers.', 'united airlines Houston to Newark with United Airlines. First my daughter was partially at fault for getting Starbucks so close to departure, but we all had boarding passes and were at the gate 15-20 min before takeoff. The family had already boarded and they decided my daughter and another minor should have arrived sooner, held them back and gave the seats to non-revs. Our daughter called and alerted us so we deplaned and were held at the end of the jetway. A manager came down to speak with my wife who was beside herself saying \"You can\\'t leave us on the plane and make our child stay behind alone.\" The manager\\'s response: \"Mam, we\\'d leave a 3 year old behind!\" Luckily another passenger was commenting on how bad the gate agent was treating our daughter when an Attendant overheard and told the Captain he needs to make it right, which he did by ordering a non-rev off the plane and my daughter onboard. Continental Airlines never treated customers this was. They are truly missed. The flight crew was awesome by the way, but I have to give a low rating because of the Gate Agents and Manager. I can\\'t support an airline that proudly states it would leave a 3-yr old behind and treat my daughter like that.', \"united airlines On 27th December, we were on a direct flight from London Heathrow to Newark and were delayed by a 'maintenance issue' by 18 hours. They did inform us promptly and were put into a hotel for the night and flew us out the next day. We were given a photocopied sheet of instructions of our rights and how to claim back compensation, but when we followed the web address, it led us to a feedback sheet which was had to be submitted online and there was nowhere to file a complaint via email. When we got home, we searched the United web site and there is no complaint department which I find shocking. We have searched high and low for help and advise on how to proceed. We have found nothing but negative feedback especially about United appearing to shirk their responsibilities when things go wrong. The flight itself was ok - but only ok. The cabin crew ranged from lovely to rude (one female crew member was incredibly angry towards me when she tripped over my sleeping husbands leg which had crept out into the aisle area). I thought the food was nice for aircraft grub and they did give a complimentary glass of wine. The plane was rather shabby - a length of trim came off the overhead locker and the crew struggled to stow it and a trim panel in the toilet came away completely when I pulled off a piece of toilet tissue. A large section of the plane was left without their entertainment screens which could not be fixed, and I was unable to connect to the inflight entertainment even though I had downloaded their app before the flight as instructed. Whilst I appreciate these things are not safety related, it did not inspire confidence in their maintenance programme. I will, like many others not fly United again unless life and limb depended on it.\", 'united airlines Gunnison to Austin via Houston. On this particular trip we flew economy plus. Our flights were delayed due to weather, with which I have no issues. It was when we got to Houston that we ran into issues. We got on our plane, backed out of the gate and then proceeded to sit on the runway for two hours. The pilot announced that he was attempting to leave to Austin before his allowed flying hours terminated, but was stopped and declared an illegal flight instead. Thus, there were no gates for us to return to. I do want to say the flight attendants were more than accommodating, but with two children under the age of 3 with us, sitting on the runway was a nightmare. When we finally got to the gate, our flight had been cancelled. So, as we deplaned, a United rep. was waiting at the gate handing out customer service number cards. She was rude and not willing to answer any questions, including: how do we get our luggage? She made no eye contact and would answer us in short, irritated responses. At the very least, United could have instructed a more sympathetic employee to stand at the gate while we deplaned. This was the beginning of customer service at its worst. The customer service line was packed, so we decided to rent a car in order to drive back to Austin, without any help or recommendations from United. The next step was to figure out how to get our baggage, and on 5 different attempts we waited on hold for assistance for two hours each, even with the Gold Member extension. When we finally were able to get an answer, we were told that our baggage would not be delivered to our home because the flight was cancelled due to bad weather, which we know not to be true due to what our pilot said to us (as stated above), and in the fact that flights were taking off around us while we were waiting on the tarmac. Moreover, on our drive to Austin, we did not have a single drop of rain, nor did we see any storms or feel any wind. That being said, all could have been forgiven if the United reps were more patient, United was a little more honest, we had a quicker answer, and United was willing to bend a little when it came to getting us our baggage (which meant an extra hour trip for us to the Austin airport to pick up our luggage). Ultimately, our greatest disappointment was in the lack of care in customer service.', \"united airlines Kansas City to Denver. Decided to visit my girlfriend for New Years and got to the airport at 4:30am on Dec 30th to check in (departure at 6). At 4:35, we are told that the flight was canceled. The pilot was sick - I don't care if you got a sick pilot, you need to be responsible and find someone else or compensate us for the trouble and canceled plans. I was fortunate enough to quickly rebook online with my phone and was on standby for the next flight. I can't say the same for the other 100 people, which had to wait until after New Years to get a flight out. As I waited for the next flight on standby in hopes of a seat, I find that they have overbooked the flight by 17 people. A family of 7 who had planned a trip to Cancun could not make it there to enjoy the vacation. Even Frontier is better than United, and it's a fraction of the price.\", 'united airlines San Diego to Detroit via Houston. This was the return leg of the trip we started on December 25th. Of the 4 legs we had, only 1 leg was our family of 5 kept together. Usually my youngest minor child (13) was placed somewhere else on the plane apart from the rest of the family. Having purchased these tickets in February 2015, I find it very hard to believe that the flight was so full at the time of purchase that my family couldn\\'t be kept together. United had my $3000 for 10 months before the flight as I paid at the time of booking. Then, when we arrive in Houston 18 minutes early,we sit on the runway waiting for our gate to be cleared. Then when the gate gets cleared 10 minutes later, they decide to change gates. What should have been a 1 hour layover is now down to a race to go from terminal c to terminal b. We double check the Airport Board to make sure we have the right gate and that the plane is on time. We do, and it says it is. We race to B76 and stand there. And stand there. Finally 10 minutes after we were supposed to start boarding we are told that the flight is delayed because they are short 1 Flight Attendant. 10 minutes later we are told the Flight Attendant for our flight called off sick, after we were told that the flight attendant was on the ground. This process continued for almost 2 hours, while they \"searched\" for a flight attendant. The time was continually bumped by 15 minutes, then a half hour, never really allowing any of us an opportunity to go get food, even though many of us had not eaten since breakfast. On top of all this, I was originally scheduled to go from San Diego to Chicago to Detroit, and the airline changed my flight without my knowledge 2 days before we departed. Because of the airlines delay I was forced to rent a car in Detroit as my arranged transportation couldn\\'t meet us after a 2 hour delay. This cost me an additional $100 as it was a last minute car rental on a holiday. I find the lack of customer service, the unfriendly seating of a family of 5 in 3 different sections of the plane to be unsatisfactory. Once United Airlines have your money you are at their mercy and they do not care. This will be the last time this family flies on United.', \"united airlines Los Cabos to Newark return with United Airlines. The flight was on time, new plane and comfortable seats, but the problem is that in a 5hr 30min flight you had to pay for food - food was also very expensive, and there was not enough food for all the passengers, so I bought the last two snack that very tasty chips and disgusting nuts. Flight attendants took more than a hour to serve everything. On the return flight EWR-SJD, when we got to the airport staff told us that the flight was canceled, but it wasn't. On the flight the same issue, food for purchase on a 6hr 30min flight - another problem was you had to pay for your baggage. On both flights there was no entertainment. Flight attendants friendly and did their job professionally.\", \"united airlines Birmingham UK to Orlando via Newark. Having pushed back from the gate we were told that a fuel pump had failed so rather than return to the gate and let us wait for the repairs in the lounge they parked us on a stand away from the terminal (Cheaper that way). Two hours later we finally left Birmingham. We noticed a 'Check Pilot' leave the flight deck to sit behind us for the flight to Newark. As we approached Newark the 'Check Pilot' re-entered the flight deck. He must have made either the Captain or First Officer nervous because we came in way too high and had to abort the landing, so around we went again by which time we had no chance of catching our flight to Orlando. The Captain informed us that the aborted landing was due to 'wind'. Yeh right, don't insult your passengers intelligence! On the ground we went to the United desk to get seats on the next flight down to Orlando. Desk clerk informed us that although we had four 'first class' seats booked and paid for, there were only three first class seats available, therefore one of the party would have to take a seat in 'coach'. OK these thing happen but we would obviously get a refund of the difference (about $250). That was in March 2015 - we made the claim in April 2015 on our return to the UK. Our travel agent received an offer from United of $100 and chose to make up the difference because of the trade we give him. We are still waiting for the refund from United! I travelled regularly between Birmingham UK and Jacksonville FL when the company was Continental with no problems. Since United have taken over, the airline is a disgrace. Having had a rubbish flight from London Heathrow to San Francisco on United a few years ago I was dubious about flying with them again. My doubts were well founded. Never again! The senior management should be looking for other jobs, preferably not in the airline industry.\", \"united airlines I have been a consistent critic of United Airlines when they have deserved it. But check in at Tokyo Narita for this itinerary was wonderful, especially since I was combining two reservations (Tokyo to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to Traverse City via Chicago) and the agent didn't have to check me through. Flight out of LAX was delayed but a very helpful agent at the Customer Service counter rebooked me, found my luggage in the system and rerouted it. It was a long day but everyone I dealt with at UA was helpful and courteous. Sometimes one gets out of these interactions with UA personnel what one puts into them.\", 'united airlines United Airlines is the absolute worst airline and their staff at SFO mirrors how they operate as a company. I booked my flight to cancun a few weeks ago and was flying out yesterday morning. Upon arrival, the plane was overbooked with 120 passengers and only 100 seats. I was of course the odd person out. I was rebooked this morning for a flight out, same time and same flight number. Woke up at 4:30am to take the train to SFO and arrived to find out the flight was cancelled. At this point, I am finished with United Airlines and done with this horrific mess of a situation. I talked to an agent to cancel my roundtrip flight and tried to search for my checked bag (which I checked for my original flight yesterday). Turns out that despite promising me that my bag would not leave to Cancun without its passenger, it ended up going yesterday morning on the overbooked flight. Now I sit here, with my holiday travel plans destroyed and a lost bag. I have to go back to SFO for a 3rd time tomorrow or Friday to pick it up. They ruined my new year and hopes of an exciting vacation.', \"united airlines By far the worst experience I have had with an airline. Flying United Airlines from Melbourne to Mexico through LAX, the flights were delayed for 6 hours. Had a similar experience on the way back and United lost our luggage! The customer service is rude and unhelpful. While waiting in the long line for customer service at LAX I overheard one of United's customer service agents joking about how she directed one customer to take the long way around the airport to intentionally cause him grief. My advice is to do anything you can to avoid flying with United Airlines. The small amount of money you may save with them is not worth the trauma. This is an airline offering the poorest quality service they can get away with.\", 'united airlines Newark to Atlanta. I am so disappointed with the service United Airlines provide. The customers service reps at Newark are so rude and disrespectful. There were only three reps working and I was sent to two different lines and had to wait in the lines at least 2 hours and I was more than early for my flight. No one informed me that my flight was cancelled. I didn\\'t get a call email or text. I spent 90 dollars for a cab. Her words were \"oh well that\\'s not happening tonight\" and \"your flight is non refundable so\". I ended up having to choose a different airline. I\\'ve never had such an unpleasant experience. United Airlines workers are of no assistance and have the worst attitudes when you need help.', \"united airlines I was travelling from Tokyo Haneda to Pittsburgh, and I'm giving this review because of the way United Airlines handled its business in light of a few storms that made travel difficult. They people need to plan better for who is going to be available to assist with bad weather operations. In Las Angeles I had a delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flight. I know its the winter months. A lot of people traveling and some potential for delays. However I plan for that. Something United Airlines failed to do. When I learned my flight was delayed and I would miss my connection, I went to the service desk. The line had about 30 people who were having the same issue. The two women working behind the desk were assisting about 1 person every 40 minutes. I'm sure you can do the math on how long this process took. Why United Airlines couldn't have more than 2 people working during the busiest months of the year when you're charging that much for a flight is beyond me. The only thing keeping United Airlines going is lack of choices. Also after being hung up on by your help desk, if I could help it I'd never fly with United again.\", \"united airlines Washington Dulles to San Francisco, and United Airlines Ground staff helpful with getting bags tagged and dropped off in crowded and cramped Dulles terminal on busy travel day. Friendly welcome by FA when getting on plane, and at least 2 food and beverage runs, plus additional water and coffee runs, done in a professional and often friendly manner. While there were several vegetarian options, wish there was a veggie breakfast wrap or bowl offered. Economy Plus seat had plenty of leg room, but I'm not a big fan of the vinyl/leather seats, which got to be uncomfortable on 5+ hour flight. Didn't pay the $7.99 for AVOD - wish it was free, but somewhere over the Rockies regretted my decision and wished I had to make the flight go faster (God forbid I should have to read a book for 5 hours). Bathroom in back of the plane was ok, but sink of one of them was out of order and covered by tape, and an insufficient number of handiwipe packets were strewn on the counter (would have been good to have them in a bowl and more of them). Departed a few minutes late, but arrived about 15 minutes early. Overall a good flight.\", \"united airlines Our flight leaving New Hampshire was delayed 2 hours which put us behind for our connecting flight in Newark. We were told not to worry, that we would be sure there would be time to connect. Watching the time in the air, we were late to land and rushed off the airplane. We consulted with an airline assistant and she assured us the plane was still here and directed us to a gate change. When we arrived, there was no record of a flight change and headed to customer service. We were then told the flight already left and we would be on the next flight at 6am : they rebooked us on a flight to Tampa (where we would have to rent a car and drive to ft Myers). We boarded the flight to Tampa, waited 40 minutes on the plane when a voice came on the speaker and alerted us that the flight had been canceled. There was no pilot to fly the plane. We were told to go again to customer service or we could call. We called and again, a representative confirmed we would be on the next flight to Tampa so we slept in the airport, on the floor, me being pregnant and traveling with my 2 year old only to find out when the attendant arrived that we were not on the flight. So here we sit, not knowing where we are going, stuck in Newark. Not one United Airlines employee has been able to give us accurate information to help us or get us where we need to go. I'm very frustrated and do not wish this fiasco on anyone.\", \"united airlines My wife and I were returning from Cancun on December 28 flight (UA1277) and it was delayed almost 2 hours. Then when we got to LAX we were told our connecting flight UA480 was also delayed until midnight 11:55pm. We waited, and around 12:30am we were notified the flight was cancelled. The next flight that was available was on Wednesday, December 30th. That's is two whole days later. We were not offered any hotel accommodations and we had no choice but to rent a car because my wife had a medical appointment (that was scheduled during our trip) that she could not miss. It was very disappointing because we waited a long time to find out the flight was cancelled. Had they told us earlier we could have found other alternatives of getting to SFO faster. Not to mention, we had no other option but to seek alternative expenses requiring us to make an additional expenses such as car rental, food, gas, and additional long term parking fees at SFO because United Airlines failed to notify us about the cancellation in a timely manner. We were not giving clear information about the refund process, they simply told us to go online and submit a request. It was the worst experience ever. I will never fly though United Airlines again. I do not recommend it to anyone. The Wi-Fi was not available either from Cancun to LAX\", \"united airlines Newark to Tel Aviv with United Airlines. This is an airline that overtly wants to demonstrate that they don't have any regard for their customers. This is for an upcoming flight. I had booked weeks before with a seat assignment for 2 people. As though it was a class magical act, the seat assignments disappeared. I attempted to receive an assigned seat and could not do so. We paid over $1000 for these seats and the UAL agent and supervisor could not, or would not, assign a seat. We are told we cannot get a seat assignment unless it is the day of departure from the airport. Unless you want to pay an extra $209 for an Economy Plus Seat. Not wanting to chance getting stuck in seats between very large travellers for 10+ hours, we accepted the ransom price!\", \"united airlines Guadalajara to Seattle. Drove 2 hours to the airport and showed up about 3 hours in advance to catch a 6:50am United Airlines flight to Houston and then catch a connected flight to Sea-Tac. The flight to Houston was delayed to 1pm because apparently the crew never showed up and the weather was bad in Houston (that part is understandable). I was forced to wait for 6 hours at the gate. Inflight entertainment was mediocre at best, but the seat comfort was acceptable. Flight attendants were friendly so the entire experience wasn't ruined. Still wouldn't recommend it due to the huge delay.\", 'united airlines Amsterdam to Newark. It goes like this - 1:25am \"Your 915am flight to Newark is delayed due to awaiting aircraft. UA71 now departs Amsterdam 955am and arrives 1220pm\". 2:00am Update: UA71 to Newark now departs at 1035am and arrives 1pm - after three more updates it\\'s now 7am. Update: UA71 to Newark now departs at 3pm and arrives 5.25pm. I start fearing about my connection before midnight. The lady tells me not to worry about it, this is the final delay! 3 hrs later - 10:05 \"Update: UA71 to Newark now departs at 6.31pm and arrives 8.56pm\". So here we are all of us stranded at the airport in Amsterdam, watching the target for boarding moving by the minute! The plane had maintenance issues and it got so long that the crew missed their working hours slot. That was the story until the 3pm delay, the funny thing is nobody knows here how to explain the further delay until 9pm. 12 hours late! I don\\'t know why I did this to myself again. Last trip with United Airlines had been a mess as well, looking at the conditions of those old 757 planes it\\'s a miracle they don\\'t have more issues.', \"united airlines I was supposed to be on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Cancun last night at 10:45 pm. I arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance, everything was going great, I was supposed to be taking a red-eye flight and arriving in beautiful, sunny Cancun when I woke up. That was until one of the staff members announced that the flight has been canceled and it has been a downward spiral ever since. I don't even know where to begin. Let's see - the flight was canceled and not even rescheduled. I have been on hold for 2 hours waiting for a customer service representative from United to answer. Then the call got disconnected, and now I am on hold yet again, with estimated wait times of 60 minutes. I'm just overjoyed. But my personal favorite is the fact that even though the airplane never even left the airport, I am unable to get my luggage. It is almost 3am. I cannot get ahold of a representative, I cannot get my luggage, I was not offered any concessions for my inconvenience, and I cannot change my flight online. Word of advice - if you want to actually make it to your vacation and not spend your entire night in the airport terminal, fly with anyone else. Too bad there's no option for negative stars. Way to ruin my vacation.\", 'united airlines Our United Airlines flight from Colorado Springs to Houston was delayed due to mechanical issues. The staff in Colorado Springs did a great job of re-routing everybody because we were all missing our connecting flights. We decided to go ahead and at least get to Houston because they were giving us hotel and meal vouchers. When we got to Houston, they send us to a horrible hotel. We tried to use our food voucher less than 24 hours later at the airport (the vouchers were supposed to be good for 2 days), but they were denied at airport restaurants. Also we paid for an upgrade in seats when we booked our trip and have yet to receive those seats. We will never fly United again.', 'united airlines Puerto Vallarta to Nashville via Houston. Poor staff management on United Airlines end caused dozens of people to miss their connecting flight in Houston. Had to spend an extra 22 hours in Houston because that was the next available flight. Started off with a 30 minute delay in Mexico, which turned into a two hour delay. The original crew told us they were, \"not legal to fly\". So, they swapped out with a different crew. Forty five minutes later, that crew announces they are not the correct crew and that they are bringing the original crew back. We wait some more on the ground. We finally take off. When we get to Houston, we wait on the taxi way for an additional 15 minutes because our gate is blocked by equipment. Well we finally make it through customs, but our flight left 30 minutes ago. United had the audacity to tell a couple passengers that they will not refund their money or get them on a different flight because it was US customs that caused their missed flight.', 'united airlines It is common knowledge that United Airlines has slipped behind both American and delta on virtually all service parameters, but their PS service decline is especially alarming as it was the market leader for a few years. Took flight 497 from Newark to San Francisco on 25 December in business first and it was very disappointing. No amenity kits, flight attendants told other passengers that there was absolutely no food available during the 3+ hour gap after breakfast, although they stood in the galley eating snacks. For a good half hour after meal service the front galley was blocked by carts so both pilots could use the facilities and socialize with the flight attendants. All passengers finished eating and trays sat uncollected. Eventually someone had to ring call button and was told off and instructed to use economy bathroom. Both front cabin attendants were unfriendly and one openly hostile to passengers. Absolutely no contact with passengers for much of the flight. Have used the new transcontinental service of American Airlines and Delta and they are much better. This is all on top of shifting PS flights to Newark which is a chaotic mess - basically a cheap mall filled with poor signage and long lines. I had the impression that every passenger in the front cabin was unhappy.', 'united airlines Los Angeles to Rio de Janeiro via Houston. United Airlines is the worst airline. From their seats, to their ticketing process and flight attendants. First of all, they didn\\'t let us purchase an upgrade to business class although the class was half empty. We paid $189 a seat for \"premium\", which was the biggest joke. The seat barely reclined. I\\'ve never ever been so uncomfortable during a flight. I couldn\\'t lift up the armrests between me and my kids, the seats barely reclined and when they did, they wouldn\\'t stay, and the width was smaller than normal. I am a regular international traveler and this is the last time I will fly with United.', \"united airlines I have mixed feelings about United Airlines. The few upsides of the flight from San Francisco to Boston were the fact that it was direct, cheap, and punctual. Also, for some reason, I was able to use Wifi without paying. However, I was not impressed with the cabin service. We started off the flight with an announcement that there was something wrong with the plane, which is never good news to hear. My seat had a disgusting stain and felt like cardboard. There was no complementary dinner even though it was a night flight, and the price was very high. The inflight entertainment system was nonexistent, and the flight attendants did the safety introduction the old-fashioned way: acting it out in the front of the plane. Unfortunately, I was in the back. United is a so-so airline, one that should be avoided unless it's the cheapest or the most convenient. Other than that, I do not recommend it.\", \"united airlines Chicago to Sao Paulo, and United Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown, with poorest in flight service. Flight attendants look annoyed. After 3 hours of flying a crew member ask me if I could leave my seat for a family with a kid since there was an empty seat next to me. He was giving me the window seat behind me, but there was someone else seating there, and that person was being rudely moved from that seat, so I told the flight attendant that I would take the other seat instead, I don't need to be watching that drama. They should be a little bit more considerate, and respect people paying for their flights. Other thing I hated about that service is the fact that they charge for spirits, they shouldn't be charge because that's a 10 hour international flight. I would prevent people that I know from flying United Airlines, and for myself, this is the last time.\", \"united airlines Vancouver to Singapore via San Francisco. United Airlines is a horrendous airline. Flight got delayed over 4 hours, trying calling to arrange for rerouting or rescheduling and after 2+ hrs of talking and waiting, they weren't able to do anything and suggested we head to the airport. Once at airport, finally managed to get rerouted through Cathay Pacific, but got stuck in airport for over 12 hours and United Airlines provided no accommodation, lounge access or compensation. Rude and disinterested customer service as well, never flying with them again.\", 'united airlines Vancouver to San Francisco on United Airlines. This airline is a complete disaster, my flight on Christmas eve continues to get delay after delay, almost 8 hours at this point. The gate staff are rude and uninterested in helping, the excuse for the delays is laughable with the airline being unable to find the flight crew, but they assure us they are ringing the hotel!! Never again', \"united airlines Flew from Jakarta to Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific, and then on United Airlines to Washington DC via Chicago. Although Cathay is partner airline, could not reserve seats or obtain boarding pass in Jakarta. Arrived Tokyo and had to wait for two and one/half hours for United Rep. Only then could I proceed to upstairs eating establishments. Flight from Hong Kong to Washington was torture since gentleman next to me in aisle seat had light on all night. The light shined directly in side of my face. Food was tasteless, staff were polite throughout fight. Have been United frequent flyer for years and often fly from IAD to Far East. With recent changes in United's frequent flyer rules and United's relentless efforts to reduce costs at expense of quality, I am searching other airlines.\", \"united airlines Manchester (UK) to San Jose with United Airlines. A 5 hour delay then lost bags. Tracking number for bag didn't work and could not get through on the phone. Had to re-visit the airport twice. On holiday now and still no luggage, we have been given 2 new times for delivery of bags but both deadlines passed and no bag. It seems the bag was re directed to Texas! Why I don't know, and neither did the airline.\", 'united airlines Every flight departed one hour late and we were unable to make reconnecting flights and were given a $ 7.00 meal voucher. Try buying a meal in Chicago for $7.00. Will not fly United again. The service representative did not seem concerned over our missed flight as it must happen over and over again.', \"united airlines Worst airline ever. Four + hours of delay for a one hour flight. Two other flights to Burbank were cancelled. Worst experience with an airline I've ever had. The airlines offered no explanation, compensation, or anything. The most ridiculous flight experience I've ever had. The amount of waiting at the airport plus the flight time is equivalent to how long it would have taken to drive there. Ridiculous is the only word to describe the experience I've had with this airline. I recommend using a different airline.\", \"united airlines Seats are horribly uncomfortable, as the headrest is poorly designed, especially for short people. The crew were impolite. The connection flight was delayed for over 3 hours, and they kept making it longer and longer. At first the departure time is 8, and then 8:30, then 9:30, then 10:30 - with an absurd reason: air traffic. Will try my best to avoid at all cost. If I'm a little bit richer, I'll definitely go with another airline.\", \"united airlines Flight on December 19 from Dulles to Paris CDG was mediocre. The check-in and boarding process was quick and expedient but I rarely check in luggage so I cannot speak to that. In-flight service is definitely not one of United's strengths. The flight attendants look annoyed and rarely smile. Anytime you ask for something, you are greeted with a sigh and a look of discontent. Also, there is very little professionalism. A passenger a few seats ahead of me made a request to use the restroom before the seat beat light was turned off citing a medical concern and the flight attendant nearby repeated the medical issue out loud to another flight attendant so that everyone could hear it. I always end up taking United not for the service but because it is in the Star Alliance and I gather miles. Otherwise, I would fly another carrier.\", 'united airlines Newark to Munich with United Airlines. The worst customer service ever. Entire problem started at check-in with electronic non-working registers, no representatives to assist. Finally one arrived, asked lots of irrelevant questions - you definitely do not want all this when rushing for a plane. 2 planes where delayed. Onboard awful service, inappropriate attitude and language, hearing 2 stewardesses chatting loudly about dates and boyfriends, not to mention small details like no greeting on plane entrance and presonnel chewing a gum in front of the passengers. The only professional in service crew was its manager who took my complaints in very friendly and respectful manner. It seems that top-management of the company does not their job properly, do not motivate employees - very easy to run out of business.', \"united airlines Orlando to Newark return. Flight to Newark was delayed 1 hour while we sat onboard due to a mechanical failure but kept well informed every 10 minutes. Both flights on Boeing 757-200 with international business first cabin with lie flat seats. Food brilliant quality, a wide variety of beverages available. Flight attendants couldn't do enough for you. Seats very comfortable with nice personal space, good inflight entertainment. Wifi available for a cost. I did use this feature but it was fairly slow even to load basics like emails and social media sites.\", 'united airlines Yet another cancelled United Airlines flight with a few shifted delays in between. Cancelled after 4 hours total delay. No hope for customers with international connections. Poor communication - cannot guarantee the seats you paid thousands for the next day. Employees always claim they can do nothing. Not the first time this would happen. They simply tell you flight is cancelled and you miss your connection. You are on your own. Why does the Government still allow them to fly? This airline is a big time rip off.', 'united airlines Never again will I use United Airlines. I always used Continental for this trip from Belfast to the northeast Coast of the US and had not major problems. But they merged with United and not for the better!! There were only two toilets on the plane, something I had never encountered before and I was in an aisle seat right near them so that for 7 hours people streamed past me, brushing into me. Screaming children in front of me and to the right for the entire flight and a crew that looked like they had staggered in off the street. The return flight was delayed by 2.5 hours with nothing on the PA nor the board so we all were running about trying to get information. The officials dealing with it were curt and in some cases rude. We kept getting bits and pieces of information as to what was going on. And both flights there was problems with the videos onboard which all did not work. The return flight had no room for my overhead and I had to wait till almost lift off for someone to take it from me and put it in the hold. Most nightmarish flying experience in my life.', 'united airlines Houston to Honolulu. Never again will I fly United Airlines. Cabin crew that I struggle to describe in polite terms. Friendly in a folksy manner. Premium Economy worth the price for the extra leg room, but many of the seats were in need of repair. On a 8.5 hour flight I was offered complimentary drink service twice. No food service - they offer snacks and light bites for sale. What I saw was less than appetizing and overpriced. The flight was on time, the pilot landed smoothly and safely in HNL, and my luggage arrived on the same flight. In the future I will make every effort to avoid United Airlines.', \"united airlines London Heathrow to Newark. Horrible flight and service - will not fly on United Airlines Boeing 767 business class product again. I am a Global Services member and had not flown business class on United's three class product in a while. Hard product was cramped with no privacy. Staff was completely unrefined and felt similar to an economy plus service level. Food wasn't terrible but overall meal service was horrible. Only saving grace was wifi service and decent entertainment system. However, going forward when there isn't a F ticket for purchase I will fly Delta or American Airlines - American has a beautiful 1-2-1 product with wifi.\", 'united airlines I travel often for business and this is the second time I\\'ve taken United Airlines from Paris to San Francisco. The service and staff are really lacking sophistication. I saw everything from a lack of manners (not using please, excuse me, etc) to hanging over customers on aisle seats to tend to customers in window seats. On both flights this happened. I usually fly Air France and one feels like they\\'re in a fine dining restaurant. Not the case with United at all. It feels like a horrible diner. I ordered a gluten free meal, which typically is lovely on other flights but with United it\\'s basically an economy meal. Worse, is that the hostess came over and showed me the tray and started unwrapping it and taking it apart. Not asking me but just saying \"What do you want me to do with this\". I tried to suggest that\\'s her job. If you\\'re looking for fine service, do not choose United.', 'united airlines I understand that things sometimes happen which are beyond the control of the staff, and delays occur. However, my experience with United Airlines today was highly disappointing not only because of the delay (approximately three hours), but because of the lack of professionalism demonstrated by the staff. Our flight attendant was not apologetic about the long, expected delay at all, but was very rude toward several passengers. One of these passengers included a woman with a baby, from whom the flight attendant grumpily took a purse and roughly shoved it into the overhead. There were no apologies from the flight attendant as we de-boarded, after another smaller delay as we waited for a free gate, and she was not pleasant toward anyone, from what I observed. This is the fourth time I have experienced unexpected delays while flying United during the past four years or so, but the first time I have ever experienced such poor service.', \"united airlines Newark to Buenos Aires via Miami. Yesterday, upon arrival to Newark airport I was told I could not get a boarding pass as I had not paid the entrance fee to Argentina. A United Airlines employee went out of his way over the course of an hour to get me online, provided me with the website and even carried my luggage to the area where he was able to print out the proof of payment so I could make my trip. I don't know if I have ever encountered better customer service. Without him, I don't think I would have made my flight. I am beyond impressed with United's Customer service and if I have a choice to fly in the future, it will be with United.\", 'united airlines United Airlines in Domestic First and BusinessFirst. The 737 at FLL was packed and overhead lockers were already well filled by the time we got on the plane. Cabin crew tried repacking but one case wasnâ€™t going to fit - the other one did. The purser eventually found a hole somewhere in the galley area - it came out freezing cold at end of flight, anyway. Service was excellent, although to a European â€œsnacksâ€\\x9d usually means something prepared - a sandwich or roll - not packs of pretzels etc. However it kept the wolf from the door, as did the wine etc. Early landing in IAH, time in the manic Club, then boarding the 787 close at hand. Seats better than the 777 on the way out, cabin crew friendly and attentive, and ok movies etc. Food was plentiful and of good quality, drinks flowed freely. Some sort of sleep, awakened to breakfast (which I didnâ€™t have, just a coffee and fruit was enough). Lots of info from flight deck. Early landing at LHR, several miles (or so it felt) hike around T2. Immigration fast for once. Baggage appeared pretty fast, and so off into the UK.', \"united airlines I had two issues flying with United Airlines from St Louis to Honolulu. Firstly they rearranged our seats after I had checked in and had moved it so that none of the seats were seated together, which I then had to waste time trying to fix since I was flying with my husband and our two infants who are both under the age of 2. The employees who were trying to fix this problem, were nothing but rude and acted inconvienced at the fact that I didn't want my 1 year old sitting by herself 3 rows behind me. My husband and I were traveling with two small infants, one who was a lap child and the other had her own seat. For her seat we brought her car seat, which for a child her age (1) is a large seat. When we asked to board first in order to avoid hitting anyone on the head with the car seat we were met with rude responses about how it's not policy to let families board first, and that we should just be more careful while boarding. Policy or not you risk people getting injured by not letting us board prior. We are just asking to get situated so others are not inconvienced by our child's needs. We in fact waited to be the last off the planes for the same reason. While traveling to St. Louis, we flew American and they had absolutely no issues with letting us board first for this reason, and were extremely nice and understanding about it.\", 'united airlines My husband and I used United Airlines for our honeymoon. The night before we left we noticed that my husband\\'s name was wrong on his boarding pass. When we explained the situation, the reps were very nice, they seemed to be working as quickly as possible and they got us on the earliest flight possible. The trip home: Our itinerary was SFO-Newark, NJ - Portland, ME. Our flight from SFO was delayed. We land in Newark and sprint to our gate with minutes to spare and were told \"that flight was cancelled\" and directed us to customer service. We wait in line for about 5 minutes before a rep states to the crowd, \"we are closing, you need to go to the other customer service line.\" We wait for about 45 minutes in the new line. When we get to the counter, the rep asks how he can help us, I state, \"We\\'d just like the earliest flight to Portland, ME please\". He asks if we\\'d be willing to split up and we explain that we\\'d rather not. He suggests a flight to Boston. I tell him we have no way to Portland after that and he says to call family (it\\'s past midnight). I say that\\'s not an option, but the rep still pushed it. 5 minutes later he suggests a 10am flight for us, we ask for that and give him our boarding passes. He scans mine and says, \"so how were you planning on getting to Portland?\" I say, \"what do you mean? with that boarding pass I just gave you.\" He explains that the flight was cancelled due to weather, which at this point we had known for hours. I say, \"yes, that\\'s why we\\'re trying to get on the 10a flight tomorrow.\" He says that our flight ends in Newark. At this point my husband and I were extremely confused because our passes clearly stated Portland. He suggests a rental car. We sleep in the airport for a few hours and rent a car. He never gave us boarding passes, and almost lost my husbands baggage claim ticket. Our TA spent a long time going back and forth with United customer service. We were confirmed for a 6am flight, despite not receiving boarding passes. She tried to get them to refund us for our car but United stated that they \"don\\'t reimburse for rental cars\". What they did was reimburse for our last leg ($45 each) and gave us each a $100 flight voucher to use within a year. We won\\'t be using them again.', \"united airlines United Airlines staff at the airports and on the plane were polite and efficient. The smaller Embraer jets are nice for the single traveler, as they're designed with a single seat on the right side, so you get both window and aisle. The extra leg room in economy plus seating is worth the extra expense ($30-$45 on the segments I flew). The seats themselves are adequate, but not comfortable. This is an industry wide problem, and not in any way unique to United. The biggest disappointment is the WiFi service. From previous experience, it seems to work very well on their Airbus fleet. The Airbus fleet usually does not have tv screens in the seat backs, so the WiFi service on those planes comes with a library of movies and TV shows to watch. This works very well if you've got a tablet or some other device to watch them on. The Boeing portion of their fleet is another matter entirely. The more recent planes have the TV screens in the seats. There's a basic program that runs during the flight, but if you want to watch anything else, there's a fee. The WiFi service on the Boeing aircraft also seems to be spotty at best. It hasn't worked at all on 3 of the 4 segments I've flown in the last couple months. The Embraer planes fly the short routes. I have yet to come across one of these with WiFi service or a seat back screen. But, given the flights I've been on have only been about 90 minutes, this isn't a big problem. Bottom line: bring a tablet or small computer and download a couple of movies on it first.\", 'united airlines Tampa to Manchester via Washington with United Airlines.

She said allowance was 50 pounds (ie 22.67Kg) and I had to remove 2 pounds before suitcase was accepted. She was totally disinterested when I informed her that I had travelled from the UK at 23Kg and why was that not accepted here in the USA to return to UK. All she could say \"2lbs must be removed\". I asked could I pay for excess and she said yes it would be 100 dollars and I agreed to pay. She then said no, it is 200 dollars and at this I said I would not pay for excess of 2lbs. I took my suitcase away, this I found to be embarrassing and removed excess. I was most upset to have to carry this 2lbs around with me all the way back to the UK.

The flight portion from PDX to DEN, the Captain / First Officer were, but the wifi did not work, and I was needing to get work done. On my return flight, MCI to DEN, the hostesses were very rude. DEN to PDX the wifi did not work again, but they were pushing to sell Direct TV. If the wifi did not work, then why would I take a chance of swiping my credit card to attempt to watch tv? The flight was delayed from MCI to DEN due to the plane setting overnight and frost had built up on the wings. Well, if you know it\\'s 20 degrees outside and you have a 6am flight, would you not de-ice the plane before everyone boards to prevent delays?

What a disaster - after a dated useless lounge and staff, the aircraft was delayed 6 hours, only to board a dated poorly equipped Boeing 757. The first class seats (1A) are extremely uncomfortable.

He had Air Serv attending him, but after asking about boarding 4 times he was left at the gate. This almost happened the year before but I as his son was at the gate and finally got the United agents to board him when they were just about to close the door. In reporting this I telephoned United and finally got someone on the phone. They said I would have to talk to a CRO at the airport. I talked to 3 people at the airport terminal and they said I would have to talk to the CRO at the gate. I got to the gate and could not determine who was a CRO. I went to the gate (Terminal B gates 1-11) to ask the security United agent if this was the right gate. She tried to answer, but with a large amount of food in her mouth could not speak and was spitting it everywhere. Really good way for personnel to be. I finally got my father on the plane and went to the Customer Service Counter. Told I had to do things online as they management will not talk over the phone. One agent did say on the sly to contact the Federal agency over airlines for help. Another agent on the sly said they just don't have enough people working to help the volume of customers they have. It seems the staff working recognize the problems, but the airlines does not. If I had a better choice I would never fly United again and I have flown them back as far as the Continental days when they were a real service oriented airlines. If you have elderly I would suggest going to the gate with them.

Upgraded tickets to First Class knowing that special perks are included (free luggage, etc). Over the months, United Airlines sent me a number of schedule changes and most were not an issues. However, the return flight from OGG to ORD via HNL has become a problem not only because they kept moving the time earlier and earlier (remember, I'm on vacation in Hawaii), but put us on Island Air which only offers economy class and charge for baggage ($80.00 for our 4 bags). This is unacceptable and in my opinion, quite unfair. I called UA's customer service and am so disappointed with the level of customer service or lack of that I received. The agent was difficult to understand due to her heavy accent and was in some ways, quite rude. Take or leave it attitude. Although she offered to move our flight to a different connection through LAX, she stated we would have to pay the difference since we upgraded to first class. How is this right? She told me that she couldn't do anything and when I explained that I have a 3.5 hour layover and that I would have to pay for bags, she didn't have any solutions for me. Rather she argued with me, told me she would talk to a supervisor, put me on hold only to come back and say that it was going to a considerable hold since her supervisor wasn't available and then continued to state she would be happy to cancel my flight altogether and refund me, but I would lose my upgrade that I used. Then she tells me that my husband's status means that we get one bag each checked free. I inquired how does this help me if I'm flying a different airline? She had no answer and again offered to cancel my tickets for a refund. How is this a solution? Her last solution was to call Island Air. Honestly, United Airlines used to be such a great airline - what has happened? Where did customer service go? What benefits do you get anymore for being loyal to an airline and actually paying to maintain a higher status (silver)? We are so disappointed. And I know that there is a very high chance that my comments will be ignored, as they have in the past when I have participated in surveys and given very honest answers with no care or response from United Airlines. I hope that this time is different.\", 'united airlines Offered a cheap upgrade to United Airlines first class. On time departure, seats were comfortable. On board service not remarkable. Offered a drink before the meal. Meal was served with water, but the FA never asked if there was anything else that was required - throughout the whole flight. I had hoped for better, but as I figured, it is the same old uncaring and poor overall service. Now I know why it was a cheap upgrade to First Class. Stay with American or Delta. They actually treat one as they should!', 'united airlines United Airlines is the worst airline to limit upgrade. I had four years in a row to have so call Global Upgrade Coupon and have never had the chance to use it. They said my booking on \"P\" class of Business Class. It is really bad. I had spent similar amount of $$$$ to purchase the Business class in other airlines, such as American Airlines and Eva Air. I always can get the upgrade while I use their upgrade coupon, such as American Airlines\\' Systems wide upgrade and Eva Air Upgrade coupons. I just had a trip on American Airlines and got upgraded while there is seat available with my systems upgrade coupon. United Airlines is not only limited certain class to use global upgrade, but also they charge big amount of money while they allow you to upgrade. The service attitude from their cabin staff in general are sometimes quite rude and not so friendly. I was not so happy with this neither. United is the worst airlines ever in the world on such upgrade programs. I am considering to drop off United Airlines in 2016 and on.', 'united airlines United airlines is by far the most insensitive airline I have ever taken. I have a service animal and requested a window seat months ago to which they said none were available after guaranteeing me the seat when I first booked my flight. Besides this, the process for taking a service dog on their airline is so complex and takes 48 hours to process I almost was unable to assure my service animal could accompany me. By paying for a flight I got nothing but greif and felt shamed by customer service for having a service animal. If anyone from United airlines actually reads this please know I will never be taking one of your aircraft ever again.', 'united airlines United Airlines from Geneva to Newark. This was the most disappointing flight in a while. While it was not possible to check in at our starting airport we only got our boarding passes prior before boarding (and gladly could sit together, because I could not make a seat reservation - well I did and then I saw after one week that suddenly my seat was a \"preferred seat\" (23A) while my friend\\'s (23B) was not, so I was booked on 29C. Strange. The aircraft: well, if you can sleep during a flight and don\\'t care about the inflight entertainment, you\\'re fine. The monitor was so small and you could see so many pixels and in addition you could switch channels. But you could not stop your movie, so when you left your seat you missed part of your movie. All in all, it was so 1990\\'s that I was looking for my Walkman instead of smartphone. The service was good though, nice staff. Food was good too.', 'united airlines I have traveled all my life and United Airlines has continuously provided the rudest service people in the business. I was on a business flight from Tokyo to Chicago and we had a large number of US Marines coming from Guam to the US. The flight attendants over-served these men alcohol and didn\\'t care if they were under age or not. They eventually became rowdy and then set up a gauntlet along the route to the bathrooms on the port side aft and were harassing women going to use the facility including using foul language and sexually explicit comments. I complained to one of the senior flight attendants and was met with hostility that I would say anything against the US Military and these (young men who she said were not doing anything wrong). I considered taping the event with my phone, but decided that if the people being harassed by drunk service men were not going to complain, then why should I. As I exited the aircraft after arrival in Chicago and was insulted with off the cuff comments by the attendant I complained to and her coworker. In Chicago, I had been denied early boarding even though I had a disability placard and was told by a really nasty desk attendant that prevented me from boarding that \"Anyone can get one of those anywhere\". I have always been treated horribly by service personnel at United especially in Chicago and all I have ever gotten with a million travel miles to my experience is a rude attitude from United. I pay more to avoid United Airlines. I note in the feedback here that this must be common and I guess that the management is just like these employees.', \"united airlines Nashville to Tegucigalpa via Houston. Positive: me and my bags arrived safely to our destination. Negative: charge for snacks, charge for in flight movies (featuring arguably the worst movie of all time: Fantastic 4. They delayed our flight 30 minutes, then 1 hour, then 1.5 hours to change out a 9 volt battery in the bathroom smoke detector and didn't let us off the flight so we could give our patronage to a decent company like Cinnabon. Instead, they make us sit on their plane allowing time for everyone to get a little hungrier, so they can extort another $4 from us for a bag of peanuts. And on top of it all, they had to file paperwork for the stupid battery before the flight could take off.\", \"united airlines The seat space is so small I could not pull down the meal tray, which probably didn't matter much since United does not provide a meal on a 9 hour flight from Chicago to Honolulu - not even a bag of peanuts - everything is pay as you go. I have never had a good experience with them, but they have many routes locked up these days. I would avoid them at all costs. Also, it used to be if you had a Chase Mileage Plus card you did not have to pay for the first bag - not any more - you have to have the Explorere Card.\", \"united airlines I'm an American living in London. I travel often to the US to visit family. The last two times (the only times) I've used United Airlines over BA, I've regretted it. Both times, the plane was severely delayed. 1st time was delayed to the next morning and the second time 4.5 hours due to mechanical failure. Both flights were also overbooked and both flights had poor service with no smile. Never again.\", \"united airlines United Airlines is the by far the most disorganized flight service I have ever been on. The first flight when I needed to come back to a military base, they booted me off my flight. When I went to the new flight that I was supposed to be on they tried to tell me my ticket was no good and tried to boot me off again. It took me pulling specific paper work from the military to get onto the flight. Now for my flight tomorrow, I had booked a reservation probably 5 months in advance. However, once again they somehow didn't have my reservation. When I called the airline sent me to a automatic robot thing that was no help at all. It wasn't until the supervisor actually went in and reinstalled my reservation. I'm sorry but I don't think you can just hit delete on a reservation that has been made 5 months in advance. United airlines is the most frustrating and disorganized joke of an airline and unless I am planning to use my ticket voucher, I plan to stay as far away as possible from this airline.\", 'united airlines Mexico City to Melbourne via Houston and LAX. Worst airline I have ever flown and I am not the type to leave negative reviews. Firstly our flight from Melbourne to LAX boarded on time but then we sat on the tarmac for 4 hours due to \\'computer failures\\'. Finally we took off, and an enormous amount of water poured through the aircraft ceiling and landed on a passenger near me, soaking her completely. We missed our connection from LA to Mexico City and were put on another flight. On the way home things really got bad. We had booked a flight from Mexico City to Melbourne with one connection in LA. We received an email from United saying they had changed our itinerary to Mexico City - Houston - LA - Melbourne, with no explanation. There were also very short transfer times in each airport. Of course, we missed our connection in Houston (where we were also instructed by United to pick up our bags and recheck them, which was ridiculous given the timeframe), and then were put onto another flight from Houston to LA, which gave us 20 minutes in LA to make our flight to Melbourne or else we would be stuck there for another day. When we asked if we would be provided with a hotel, we were told \"Sorry, none of this is our fault\". We rushed and somehow made the flight to Melbourne in 20 minutes, which was incredibly stressful. Arrived home thinking it was all over, and they had lost one of our bags. Worst customer service given the repeated inconveniences.', 'united airlines Anchorage to Taipei via Denver and Tokyo returning to SFO. This itinerary was a comedic failure of customer service on United\\'s part. While confirming flight status with a United Rep in the Philippines the rep was constantly mixing up past, present, and future tense. I was not going to get off the phone until I understood my itinerary changes. Frustrated, she screamed at me for not understanding and disconnected the call. On the return flight from Osaka to San Fransisco an elderly lady next to me couldn\\'t use her in-flight entertainment and it was stuck on a program she found disturbing (it is fixed into the seatback). She was ignored by flight staff repeatedly and I had to assist her for the duration of the flight. The cabin crew pointed at my tattoo and asked if it was Jewish (it\\'s not, but who asks something like that). A glass bottle of whiskey broke in my bag and it was returned to me at SFO in a clear garbage bag with a booze puddle at the bottom. The staff didn\\'t help, but just said \"We aren\\'t responsible for this\" and set it at my feet and walked away. No napkin. No \"Hey I know this stinks but here is a trash can where you can pick the broken glass out of your clothes.\" No, \"We can\\'t take responsibiliy for the breakage but we are really sorry this happened.\" Just \"Here\" I boarded my next flight the following day in whiskey-soaked clothes. Anchorage to Denver, I mistakenly sit on the wrong side of the isle boarding and the stewardess told me \"Remember, just like elementary school, A, B, C, D\" which is an inappropriate way to talk to an adult. Overall customer service was careless at best, actively rude at worst. I will not put any more miles into their frequent flyer program and have cancelled my credit card.', 'united airlines I flew from San Diego to Chicago to fly to Buffalo. First, they cancelled my flight to Buffalo. I reached Chicago at 4am. They gave me the next flight at 10:47 so I waited for 7 hours. Then everything started after.

After repeating, again and again the date of travel, this person finally managed to check the schedules and found a morning flight. I listened carefully, without interruption, to the flight times and flight numbers. United\\'s agent said, \"OK, sir, I have you booked on flight XXX from LA to NY to Dallas. Can I have your credit card information please? I thought it strange that a United flight would travel across the USA to NY, turn aound and then fly to Dallas. I asked the agent if there was a more direct flight available and he replied, \"No.\" I then said to the agent, \"Why is it necessary to fly first to NY and then to Dallas.\" The agent replied, \"Sir, this is our schedule. A short lay over in NY and then to Dallas International.\" Dallas International? I lived in Dallas for many years, and always knew the airport as DFW/Dallas Ft. Worth. Are you talking about Dulles International (not Dallas) in Washington, DC? The United agent replied, \"Yes sir, of course.\" I said, \"No thanks,\" and hung up the phone. I was seconds away from giving this United agent my credit card information for an incorrect flight because of his inability to understand English. Last week I again telephoned United and was again connected to an agent with less than perfect English speaking ability. I hung up the phone.

And when I have trouble communicating with a vendor about such products because of a language issue, then I become wary and concerned that my questions and/or instructions will be either misunderstood or ignored. Find another vendor. United needs to understand that it\\'s employees become their public image. And employees that cannot communicate properly will give the public a bad impression of United. United apparently does not understand that poor communication means poor customer service. And poor customer service always means a loss of business. Another issue is trust. It is my choice where to spend money, and with whom to travel.', 'united airlines I must be insane. I keep giving United Airlines a chance, expecting its service and commitment to getting a flight to take off on time right. And it is always the same. Incoming flight late for some undisclosed reason, various mechanical failure like light out, toilets not working, etc. Been the same poor customer service the past 10 years.

However the boarding attendant in Denver told everyone over speaker that they had been dealing with the issue for 3 days. My question is if you have had a broken down plane for 3 days don\\'t you think you would consider finding an alternative solution to this problem prior to your booked flight checking in? So we get on the plane, fine we had a bit of delay still not angry except for the attendants with nasty attitudes! The only person that was halfway decent on this flight was the lady handing out the snacks! I was rudely asked to put my clutch under my seat that was safely strapped around my body with my personal contents inside (it\\'s smaller than an ipad) that I wasn\\'t asked to \"stow away\" on my previous flight. And an elderly man was refused the bathroom after we had been sitting at the St Louis airport for 10 minutes and had another 20 to wait because even though our flight was delayed 2 hours they still weren\\'t ready for us to land which is crazy to me to think, you would think you would get more on top of it United.

These are difficult keep track of, United does not make any ore in your account that you have these credits, and also difficult to use. I requested to find out what percentage of these travel certificates are actually redeemed and the airline informed me they do not share this information with the public or their customers.

I will try to avoid United Airlines when booking my next flights.', \"united airlines Chicago to Paris CDG with United Airlines. Because of maintenance issues with aircraft, we had to turn and go back to Chicago about four hours into the flight. When we got back to Chicago, they were able to provide hotel accommodation but rescheduled the flight for 8:00 a.m. which was quite irritating as we didn't arrive in Chicago until past midnight. To make matters worse, when I arrived at about 6:30 the next morning for flight, apparently would not be leaving until 5:00 p.m. because that was in fact earliest we could leave due to the open hours schedule of French border control. Is United Airlines seriously that inexperienced with international flights that they wouldn't have known this when rescheduling a flight, or at least would been able to check the aircraft properly before leaving Chicago the first time? They will definitely be my last choice in future international flights.\", 'united airlines I had a lot of United frequent flyer mileage I had to burn off, and our 4 trips on United were absolute nightmares. Will never ever fly United again. I could spend 3 hours writing what happened on each flight. This is about our April 2015 trip to Maui. We pulled away from the gate at LAX (Los Angeles and headed down the runway.) The pilot then pulled the plane off the runway. He came on the loud speaker and said he thought the plane was too heavy. We were seconds from takeoff. Pilot said it would take 20 minutes for United to calculate the weight of the cargo and passengers. The plane sat there was no air conditioning and it was 90F on board. Every 30 minutes the pilot came on the loudspeaker and said United was still calculating the weight. Our plane was huge and there was 2 toilets on the entire plane. 14 or more people in line for the 2 toilets the entire time on the runway and in the air. The passengers demanded that the plane return to the terminal due to the heat on the plane and lack of food. We were on the runway now 1 hour 45 minutes. Passengers told the crew that we were going to call CNN and report this. Surprisingly the pilot did. 2 passengers got kicked off and I think one small box in cargo was taken off. We left LAX 2 hours late. No food on board. Total flight time to Maui was 8 hours instead of 5 hours and no food, but they sold box of crackers for $11.', \"united airlines Missed my connection home due to mechanical issues of the plane.

I rented a car to drive home that late night/ morning. I was told to submit my receipt for reimbursement. United decided not to reimburse the rental but sent me a travel certificate. Just a way to make me purchase another ticket from them. In the end, they didn't give a damn. They screwed up, I paid the price. They will continue to screw up until there's a real impact to their bottom line.

This time I opted to upgrade to Business Class on all three routes. Checking in was a breeze in EWR and security was surprisingly easy this time. Minor note, there is absolutely no reason to ever go to the Presidents club anymore in EWR with the updated food options in Terminal C. I would rather pay for a decent breakfast/lunch/dinner then eat the garbage they offer in the Club for \"free\". The seats were nice, however they allow too much recline for seats given the limited seat pitch. The gentleman in front of me reclined all the way back and I struggled to exit my seat to use the facilities without being very disruptive. Apart from the minor issue with the seats everything else about the flight was more than acceptable. The food was good not great. We were offered a decent breakfast, however the coffee is dreadful and the tea no better. The flight attendants were attentive and very cordial the entire time. Flying back thru to EWR from PVR via IAH was just fine except for the disaster that is IAH security. We nearly missed our connection due to extremely long queues to pass back through security after clearing customs. I have never seen only one line open in IAH when you have multiple flights trying to get through security at the same time. There were multiple people in line with us that missed their connections.', 'united airlines United Airlines is competing with low-cost airlines and it shows. Only the service is worse. I booked my trip on Air Canada. It was a code share flight operated by United. I wanted to switch to a morning flight and had been told to speak to the ground crew to do that. The United staff would not let me change the flight, saying it was their ticket, and added that the code sharing was just a marketing trick, and \"why would we do anything like\" changing your ticket. Fortunately, the Air Canada ground crew was more reasonable, and booked me on the (half-empty) morning flight on Air Canada. More than their incompetence (obviously it could be done since the AC rep did it for me), the United reps\\' rudeness was bizarre. I cancelled my United credit card today. The first leg of my trip was on United. That was the last time I fly on that airline.', 'united airlines Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles return with United Airlines. Seats very uncomfortable. Staff very rude and seemed to have little first aid training. We flew on 4 flights during which there were 3 medical emergencies. My daughter is a nurse and attended to passengers on each occasion. Staff had little first aid training, supplies were minimal, equipment were faulty. The food was disgusting and there was a lack of it for a long international flight. Return flight to Melbourne flight was overbooked, we could not sit together. I would never fly this airline again.', \"united airlines San Francisco to Orlando. We were surprised how good United Airlines were after reading the reviews. Plane was clean and comfortable and after getting off an 11 hour Air New Zealand long haul flight we were expecting very small cramped seats - but there was not actually a lot of difference between United and Air NZ. What was appreciated was when the cabin crew asked if I would like the three seats behind me and allowed me to move prior to take off. So 6 seats between 3 made it even more comfy. We didn't expect IFE or food so no problems there. Plane departed on time and arrived early. Cabin crew and ground staff all pretty good. I'm taking off a point for no snacks and no IFE but I'm giving a bonus point for friendly cabin crew and generous drink serves. We have long haul flights on United in March which we were dreading, but now not so much.\", \"united airlines Newark to Toronto.

United Airlines blamed Orbitz, Orbitz blamed United Airlines. United Airlines say they will happily re-book and the only available flight was the next evening. Didn't offer hotel or food voucher for me and my kids - they say it's not their fault. On our flight back to John Wayne, United Airlines again didn't have me and my kids on their flight plan.

I told him I would not stay the night and find me another flight. He did on American Airlines. Got into Orlando 2 hrs late. Flight home was just as bad.

Lie Flat seats decent except the 2-4-2 seat layout is an abomination. Glad I didn't get stuck in middle for USD7K ticket. Not sure who came up with that layout but should probably be fired.

Will do everything I can to avoid using them in the future. Doubt they will do well when gas prices increase in the future.', \"united airlines First time I flew with United Airlines. I wasn't very happy that I was charged for my bags and wasn't allowed not even one bag free. I was forced to pay for my bag. This is unacceptable, because that same day I flew there were other United Airlines flights that were going out and I noticed that the other passengers from the other flights, were not being charged for luggage. I feel that the customers should be made aware of that you have need to pay for luggage. This is the last time I fly with United Airlines.\", \"united airlines Minneapolis to Brussels via Chicago. United Airlines Premium economy class makes international flights easier and more comfortable especially on less crowded flights. The premium seats are usually emptier and provide an inexpensive way to survive long haul flights. Great recline and roomier space make for a comfortable journey. I've been traveling with United for years and have begun branching out with other carriers with an eye on improved differences. On United flights, I've frequently had access to power outlets and love the TV monitors at each seat with an above average choice selection of movies. In the last year they've changed their economy class breakfast snack upon arrival to European airports and not for the better. We used to get a warm croissant, juice and fruit. Now you get just a cold croissant with choice of orange juice, coffee or tea. Wish they would stop downgrading services, complaining about the competitors and up their standard sand do more to keep the customers they already have.\", \"united airlines Melbourne to Los Angeles to Chicago, returning from Boston. We thought the extra money for Premium Economy worth it for the International leg. Not only is there extra legroom but there were many spare seats. So a bit of moving around enabled plenty of cabin space for these long flights. Domestic flights are an entirely different matter. On all our legs United Airlines oversold tickets to ensure every seat was taken. Their loading policy is bizaar. We were always last on (group 5) because we had asked for aisle seats. On any other airline this would probably not matter but because United does not enforce its own carry on luggage rules, the last 50 or so passengers on all the internal legs we flew, had to at the last minute submit to having their carry on luggage removed and sent under plane. This is maybe not a big deal on a short 5 hour flight but our carry on was taken off us as we came down the loading trunk and booked through to Melbourne, two whole days away. Scrabbling to get out medications etc in the unheated trunk in the freezing air of Boston Airport is no fun. (I'm 67) so difficult to get down to get stuff out let alone remember all the things you may need on such a long journey. So shame on United, I'd paid as much as anyone in Economy and some had carry on whilst arbitrarily others did not and for such a long journey. They treat customers with absolute contempt and do not deliver what you have paid for.\", 'united airlines Washington to Phoenix. Embarrassing is the first word that comes to my mind for United Airlines. For a flight of 5 hours, a Boeing 737 with narrow pitch in economy. Food is with a charge (at the beginning I thought it was a joke), not even peanuts (for a 5 hour flight). No video or audio systems or screens with flight routes/flight information. Boarding with \"groups\" system, but non effective and useless, as if you use groups, you should board the bottom passengers first to avoid \"traffic jams\", if you do random groups, it just a waste of time. In Europe we have a low-cost airline called Ryanair, which is considered mostly like a bus carrier, but compared to United Airlines it is like Swiss. And this should be a Star Alliance company? Never again.', 'united airlines Check in at IAH was quick although we were overweight 1lb in one bag and were forced to transfer a jacket to the other underweight bag. I guess rules are rules but I wish United were as stringent in applying their carryon rules. The usual kerfuffle with too many/oversized carryons was experienced on the domestic leg. The FAs handled this situation and the service during the 100% full flight efficiently. Our flight to Sydney was delayed a few hours due to the late arrival of our aircraft but we were kept up to date with the situation by email and gate announcements. Another 100% full flight but boarding via the United group system works well and there was little aisle congestion, apart from the usual oversized carryon bag problem. The FAs were great the whole flight. Nothing seemed to be a problem. Water runs were frequent. The food for both dinner and breakfast was passable although serving/collecting the breakfast 90 mins before arrival on a full flight is rushed. This resulted in the hand out of the landing cards during the descent which is not optimal. especially for families. The IFE worked well with a great selection of movies and TV programs. The toilets were kept in reasonably good condition the whole flight. Seating in economy is tight and becomes a little hard after some time but you get what you pay for. My experience is that E+ is not worth the extra money even on a 14 hour flight. Another satisfactory experience with United Airlines.', 'united airlines First Class, Seat 4-D with United Airlines, comfortable seat, middle solo row, AVOD screen nice size and good selection of movies and programming. Aircraft was clean however my game controller was jammed and did not work, could not be repaired in flight. Good on time performance. Before departure first class flight attendants eating while boarding process. No service until almost 60 minutes into flight. The meal served, Dim-Sum was the worst I have ever had, dry and tasteless. Flying United is always a gamble and the service by the cabin crew was extremely poor and not attentive.', 'united airlines I just tried to make a reservation with United Airlines. It has been years since I have flown with them because they were so awful then. It appears they have muscled out JetBlue and Virgin for this direct route. And they know we have little alternative to flying with them. I tried to make two reservations. They say on the website to call to request certain things. I called. I stated my request. They said please hold - then they put me on hold for 37 minutes. When another person picked up there was no apology or explanation and I was told there was a form I had to fill out and send in for disability related issues. She acted indignant that I didn\\'t have my personal medical info \"on file\" with them. Please God give us a different airline to fly.', 'united airlines After having flown on United Airlines 4 times, I can honestly say I hope I never have to use them again. The co-pilot was late for 2 of the flights which caused us to be late for our connecting flight. Almost missed my plane home - I made it, but sadly my baggage did not. As I was waiting for my bag to arrive last night at the baggage claim, I finally grab it only to notice that the carry strap at the top is missing. It had hooks on it to secure it to the bag and it has endured flights before, just not this one! Someone must have needed the strap more than me. As I picked up the bag and headed for the claims office, I find the bag is covered in grease which now has gotten on me...The claims woman\\'s response to my question of \"what are you going to do about this?\" was answered with \"I don\\'t know\". They said I could bring the bag back up, a 50 mile one way trip for me, to have them send it out for cleaning. All I can say is don\\'t fly with this airline - if you can avoid them, do it.', \"united airlines Pittsburgh to Colorado Springs via Denver. Substandard service all around and it pains me to write this since I have Premier status with United Airlines. However, it's clear that there is a problem at the top because everyone associated with United, whether it's an attendant, customer service representative, or whomever appears apathetic and frequently rude toward their customers. And as a Premier member I can only assume that non-Premier members get even worse treatment. The service on the flights is inconsistent. The cabins are frequently dirty with used napkins on the floor or in the seatback pockets. It's really unfortunate and I'm looking for alternatives.\", 'united airlines My carry-on bag fit easily into the overhead bin on the United Airlines Boeing 737 from Mexico City to San Francisco. After clearing U.S. immigration and customs in San Francisco, I was forced to then check my bag and pay $40 in San Francisco for my next flight to Portland.', 'united airlines London to San Francisco return. We have flown with United Airlines several times, but I think they are giving a poorer service now than they have ever done. The food on our return flight was terrible, and most passengers did not eat it. The cabin staff, especially the female staff, were scruffy in appearance and not very helpful.', 'united airlines I used to love Continental, the service was consistently above average and the flight experience was satisfactory, if not enjoyable. Since the merger with United I feel the benefits have been reduced, the services have been cut or monetized. This has created a tough environment for your employees to maintain good service. That being said, I was very impressed by the agent at the gate during boarding. Our flight was overbooked and my 8 year old son and I were seated in different rows. With no incentives to give to other passengers she found a way to get us seated together. Once aboard I was surprised to find that the flight did not include any type of in-flight entertainment, no screens and no audio. I gladly purchased it on the 5+ hr flight from EWR to PHX, but this was not even an option on the return. I was also surprised that there was NO safety demonstration given on the flight, which is definitely unsafe and possibly in violation of FAA rules. Lastly, the variety and quality of food available for purchase was poor. After flying over 250,000 miles with Continental/United, when possible I now actively avoid and will pay higher fares to select other airlines that offer better service.', \"united airlines I had flown in from Amsterdam on KLM and I was connecting on a United Airlines flight into Chicago in the early afternoon around 5pm. I had plenty of time clearing both customs and enjoying the AC Maple Leaf lounge at Pearson but the United personnel at check-in failed to explain that after checking in on my UA flight I had to check the bags myself prior clearing US customs - so my bag remained in the departure area for some 4 hours without having anyone page me! 40 minutes before departure the person at the gate called my name and asked me to go back to departure to check my bag. It's useless to mention that I rushed downstairs, found my bag, missed my plane and had to clear both customs again with thousands of people waiting in line. There is something wrong with United Airlines! Why don't they tell passengers that they have to check their own bags prior clearing customs? I had a business class ticket and of course the 7:15pm flight only had economy - at least I made it to Chicago that same day but not one word of apology for misleading me or even, check my bag so that I won't miss my flight. I will not fly United Airlines again.\", 'united airlines San Francisco to Frankfurt in United Airlines Business Class on the upper deck in an old Boeing 747 fitted with the new flatbed seats and TV screens. The seat was the only redeeming feature of the product. The interior of the aircraft looked so worn down. In-flight service in United was efficient and friendly, but did not have the touch of class you get with, say the Lufthansa Business Class product. In-flight wi-fi worked quite well. The flatbed seat made the flight comfortable, but everything else about it was forgettable.', \"united airlines Los Angeles to Melbourne with United Airlines in BusinessFirst on the new Boeing 787, which is a great aircraft. The exceptionally poor service by the cabin crew made the trip memorable for all the wrong reasons. The whole experience started on a rather odd note, when boarding the flight I was asked if I had a visa for Australia. I thought it was a rather unusual question given that I was traveling on an Australian passport. And when I attempted to explain that I don't need a visa to go home, she continued to argue that I need to present one. And it all went downhill from there. When I finally boarded the plane and I was offered a drink, I politely asked if I could have a glass of water without ice. I was thirsty as I just raced through LAX to make my connecting flight home. And I could not believe my ears when the crew member responded with the question 'What's wrong with you?' Now I know why United has such a poor reputation. It's such a shame though as their planes are on par with other airlines. Just can't get the service right.\", \"united airlines I found myself on a United flight bak to London by accident recently after British Airways had to change aircraft from an A380 to a B747 which meant they had to re-book quite a few passengers onto alternative flights. I must say when I heard I was going back on United I was pretty disappointed as I've always thought of them to have a pretty mediocre reputation. However, I think that mainly applies to their domestic US operations. Perhaps because my expectations were low, I was pleasantly surprised. I think I ended up in United's Premium Economy, Economy Plus. The main selling point here being the extra leg room, which I have to say was pretty ample for economy class. The staff both on the ground and in the air were excellent, very friendly and professional. The inflight entertainment was so-so, but comparable in many ways to that of British Airways on my flight out. There was very little choice in the way of films and TV shows.Many of the TV shows only seemed to have one or two random episodes available to watch.The screen was pretty small though and it was really tricky to select the required item on the touch screen. The cursor kept on hovering over the wrong item. Although annoying, on a 7hr flight it did the job. The food was pretty mediocre I have to say - like a deeply budget ready meal. I know airline food is never going to be that great, but compared to other long haul flights i've taken recently with the likes of Cathay Pacific and even BA, it was pretty bad. Also, the wine on offer was from a juice carton which was ominous - it tasted like it was from a juice carton too. Not sure they'd be my first choice in the future, but not as bad as I was expecting. For the 7hr journey across the atlantic it did the job.\", 'united airlines Terrible customer service, and they really just want to find any possible way to take your money. I had to switch a flight for work for personal reasons, and got charged a $200 service fee plus some other $35 fee that seemed inexplicable. I got the $35 taken off, but the $200 service fee for changing the flight is outrageous. I usually prefer to fly Southwest when I can and I have never had much of an issue with United Airlines before, but I definitely will be looking at them through a different lens now.', \"united airlines Worst airplane for long United Airlines flight and Horribly cramped. The plane is designed to cram in as many passengers as possible regardless of comfort and convenience. There are only 2 lavatories and the doors swing into the aisle. Absolutely stupid design. People are backed up in the aisles and the crew is impeded from serving. The crew detests this aircraft too as they can't do their jobs. Also there is very little leg room. My husbands knees were hitting the seat in front. There is no pouch to put your book or newspaper in. All end up on your lap or the floor. I will avoid this type of plane in the future.\", 'united airlines I booked a United Airlines flight for me and my boyfriend in April 2015 for a trip to Taiwan in October 2015. We chose United in order to connect in San Francisco with my brother. I had more issues with this flight than I have ever had in my life of flying internationally. A month before our trip, our connecting flight from SFO to LAX was cancelled, and we were rebooked for a layover that was twice as long (3 hrs). 8 hours before our flight to SFO, we received an email at 1AM that our flight had been cancelled. Upon calling customer service and asking why it was such a short notice and why we weren\\'t called, only emailed, I was yelled at because \"we were notified, weren\\'t we?\" Luckily I woke up in the middle of the night so we managed to rebook a flight for an hour earlier. An hour before our rebooked flight, it is announced that the flight has been delayed for 5 hours, so we miss our connecting flight with my brother, and we end up waiting at the airport for 5 hours and connecting in Tokyo instead of SFO. On the flight, my inflight entertainment console broke and was stuck on \"Disney movies\" before we even took off. For our trip home, our seats were changed from an aisle and a middle seat to two middle seats without notice. I have never been so frustrated flying with an airline and am extremely upset that we booked so far in advance in order to fly with my brother and land at the same time, and we could not make that happen. 0/10, never flying United again.', 'united airlines I was never so angry and heated in my life. First of all United Airlines had me sit there from 11 am and kept delaying even though the weather was fine in both locations. Then they told us that they were waiting for the crew - then leaving - and then by 4 they just canceled my flight home. I had to wait in line for 2 hours even though I was the 5th person in line, because 3 ladies were helping only one person at the time and the 3 ladies were rude to customers. I was put on standby but luckily found another flight to get home. When on that flight the flight attendant told me that there was another flight to Buffalo canceled due to the same reason of not having enough staff. Really United? How do you not figure this out in advanced! Very disappointed, better off spending the money and going on a different aircraft.', \"united airlines We flew United Airlines to Honolulu from Heathrow via LAX (connecting flights 2 hours apart), later from Honolulu to Seattle via San Francisco (connecting flights 2 hours apart), later San Francisco to London Heathrow via Chicago (connecting flights 1 hr. 24 hours apart). It was our first time with United Airlines. Every flight was on time, connections easy due to the helpfulness of ground staff. During the flights the attendants were helpful and friendly. The food was so-so but we don't expect gourmet on planes. Due to the duration of some flights we had upgraded to Economy Plus seats, a must for longer journeys, and we had gone online to select our seats as soon as we received booking confirmation - go for the exit seats within your booking class of seat for 2-3 times the leg room of others in the same class. I have seen complaints from somebody who turned up at check-in and expected to get four seats together for his family and complained when they weren't available. Do it online to avoid problems. I sympathize with people who have had bad experiences, most of which are totally unacceptable, but felt that we saw a different side to report and show it is not all negative. We have no ties to, or preference for, United Airlines or any other airline, and hope our 'luck' continues regardless of who we fly with. To those who have suffered, may your future journeys be as trouble free as ours was.\", \"united airlines Having only flown United Airlines a few times on this route I never really took notice of the service provided. However this time it occurred to me that United Airlines are in a time warp that goes back to the late 80's. Their inflight customer service, food and entertainment are so poor that they lag behind other airlines by years. Wake up United, get into the real time and update.\", 'united airlines I have been saving up my airline miles for the last two years to use on a trip for my husband and I. I thought I had plenty of miles to get us two tickets. We weren\\'t even going across country, staying on the same coast. They took 35k miles + $86 for just one ticket. And the only options in seats you get are all the way in the back, unless you want to pay extra to \"upgrade\" on an old uncomfortable aircraft. And don\\'t forget I pay a $95 annual fee! What\\'s the point of being a club member again? United Airlines program is less than satisfactory. It\\'s misleading and I feel like I got scammed. The worst program I\\'ve ever used. I think I\\'ll go back to Alaska Airlines.', 'united airlines I print my boarding passes to find out they changed my flight departure with a 30 min connecting time from a 50min initially! No notice, nothing - just changed it. I spent then another hour on the phone to switch it to a different time only to be told \"oh 30mins is a decent time to catch it\". Had to tell her while booking the flight it said the flight was overbooked. By the time I run to the connecting flight I will have no seats. Finally I convince her to switch it. I had initially booked a window seat. Told her specifically to book the window seat again. She agrees, and I get the email only to see its the middle seat. I asked again is this the window seat and she said yes. Went online to double check it, she did give me the middle seat. Then tells me there are no seat available! This is not the first time. This is the final straw!', 'united airlines Horrible choice for passengers with disabilities. I called to ask what their procedures were for requesting a pre-board, and after 45 minutes of being routed from place to place and being asked to provide unrelated information, I was told that I would need to prove my condition before my question could be answered. I spent nearly $600 to change my flight to another airline and will not fly United again.', 'united airlines Singapore to Washington Dulles via Tokyo. United Airlines has a weird system that messes up upgrade request. I was waitlisted for the business upgrade but at the time of check in, I was told that I was not even on the list. No one could explain as to how my name disappeared from the list. This has happened to me the third time. Very frustrating, especially when you book in advance to be on top of the wait list. At the time of check in again I was manually included in the list which put me as the last one on the list. Crazy. I am very disappointed with United.', \"united airlines Absolutely horrible service. My original booking was changed by United Airlines after I had paid - they changed the times. I called to see if I could get on an earlier flight, as I needed to be there before a certain time window. The woman on the phone was pleasant and polite but she kept putting me on hold and the whole process took over 1.5 hours. After confirming flight numbers and times, she sent me an email confirmation. I reviewed it after we had hung up and she scheduled the wrong day. I immediately called back and now they can't fix it back to the original or to the correct day without charging me. Are you kidding me. I do not recommend United Airlines at all.\", 'united airlines I had to be in Cincinnati for a business meeting g at 5.00. I left Portland, Oregon at 6.00am. Arrived in Houston at 11:45. The flight from Houston was delayed by two hours. I missed my meeting. No one at United Airlines knew what was going on, the agents were rude, numerous gate changes. I will never fly United again if I can help it but these airline monopolies are a real problem. United has really gone downhill.', 'united airlines I applaud United Airlines for attempting to only allow passengers with 2 pieces of carry-ons. However the customer service in regards to only allowing 2 pieces of carry-ons needs to be improved. Flight out of Seattle to Cincinnati via Houston had rude customer service at the boarding gate. If everyone is allowed 2 pieces of luggage to carry on, then the service on the plane also needs to follow and hold the passengers accountable, ie. one piece of luggage on top while the second piece must go underneath the seat. Just because I do not pay the extra to fly first class, does not mean my luggage is less important. I\\'m a frequent flyer with United (140k in miles), or at least I was until this past weekend, so you would think that making sure each and every customer would be valued by United. Flying back from Cincinnati to Seattle, via D.C. was just atrocious. Arrived in Cincinnati, only to find my flight was delayed 30 mins due to a late inbound flight - but why did it take United 20 mins before I was to board my plane to email me that information? Then another 20 mins later, received an email that the flight was delayed another 30 mins and the gate changed (luckily just the gate over). My connecting flight out of D.C. to Seattle would surely be missed as I would still be in the air while my flight to my final destination would be taking off. Many of us were in similar predicaments. We were speaking with the woman at the boarding gate, and she advised us our flight was out of the original gate (A11). Then when we all showed her our email from United stating our gate was out of A13, so needed to radio down to ask. One person came back on the radio that the flight to D.C. was out of A11, while another person responded with out of A13. When the gate was determined, the woman at the boarding gate now needed to find if the flight to D.C. was first or if the flight to Houston was next as boarding was soon going to happen. Needless to say, my flight was messed up and I ended up staying in Cincinnati for another night. The next day (Oct. 12), I attempted to fly out of Cincinnati to Seattle via Houston. As soon as I arrived at the airport, I yet again received an email from United that my flight was delayed. Surely this wasn\\'t all going to happen again. I was flying out of the same gate, so perhaps? With that flight being late, we were not sure if I would make the connecting flight to Seattle out of Houston. My flight from Cincinnati to Houston was a little over 2 hours and all passengers were able to get a full can of soda. Luckily, passengers were nice and allowed people at the back of the plane to get off in order to maybe make their connection. Rushed to make the connection and the women at the gate were extremely rude. We told one that others were coming from the late flight out of Cincinnati and her response was \"We cannot hold the gate for anyone. You can stay and wait and see if the rest of you party makes it though, but we cannot hold the gate for anyone.\". The second woman (taking the boarding tickets) was just as rude. Again the whole you can only have 2 pieces of luggage is fine, but when you are following the rules, having to check your bag at the gate is absurd when United does not actually enforce the \"the second bag must go under the seat.\". Something needs to be changed on United\\'s end to continue having paying, satisfied customers.', 'united airlines After years of collecting credit card points we decided to use them to fly first class from Toronto to Hawaii and back. We had to go with what was provided. The first flight from Toronto to Los Angeles was in first class on Air Canada. We had a \"pod\" type seat which reclined flat. We were provided with comfortable pillows and a comforter. We had our own individual screen and could watch movies, tv, etc. The food was great and service equally as good. It was everything we had imagined first class would be. We had the same first class treatment from Los Angeles back to Toronto. The polar opposite is true of our United Airlines portion from Los Angeles to Hawaii. The plane is old and first class only means wider seats that recline slightly more than economy with more leg room but extremely uncomfortable to try and sleep in. Besides the food, the only extra we got was a paper thin blanket - no pillows, no screens, no music, nothing. You have to download the app if you want to watch something or listen to music. What if you don\\'t have a smart phone or don\\'t want to watch a movie on it? The flight to Hawaii was bad enough but unfortunately we were stuck with United Airlines on the overnight flight from Hawaii back to Los Angeles and hardly slept a wink. Ironically before we left home, I decided to leave my neck pillow at home. Why bring it - we were flying first class. Big mistake. United\\'s definition of \"first class\" is no class. I regret wasting the points I took so long to collect on the United Airlines flights. I will never knowingly fly United again. Giving this a 2 only because the flight attendants were friendly and I felt sorry for them having to work for this airline.', 'united airlines Twice in the last six months I have purchased United Airlines first class tickets only to arrive at the airport and find out we were in coach for the return trip. The first time we paid $600 in baggage fees because we had packed all of our bags to 70 pounds instead of 50. We were given the option of flying another day first class and not having to pay the baggage fees but there was no compromise on the baggage the day planned to fly. The same thing happened again today and I was forced to change my flight to fly first class in again not pay overage fees on my baggage. This really looks like a scam to me.', 'united airlines Awful. United Airlines plane from the 1970s to and from Hawaii. Denver to Kona is the same flight length as going to Europe, yet still has one tiny movie screen playing a terrible PG movie. United Airlines needs to upgrade its planes as it is far behind the other airlines in the era of technology. Will not fly again until they do so.', 'united airlines We had a major flight delay (3 hours) on Oct 11th. No e-mail notification from United till 2:05 for a 3:59 flight. There was an earlier flight on Air Canada but customer service said it had no seats left and that it was oversold when in fact not only was it not oversold there was one seat left. The ladies at both counters were brutal, the customer service was awful. Long lines and understaffed! Angry woman with absolutely no coordination between either airline. In the end they earlier flight ended up with more seats available and was delayed itself 30 mins - but do you think they wanted to be helpful and get us easy passengers with carry on bags on that flight? Nope. I fly Southwest Airlines for a reason. I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone. I paid lots of money for a non-stop, good timing flight and now this!', 'united airlines We sat on the LAX terminal for about 30 plus extra minutes waiting to take off without A/C. The two flight attendants seemed like they had no clue what to say or do before the flight even took off. We left at 7:30ish from LAX and planned to land in San Antonio around midnight, about 11pm we get notified we\\'re making an emergency landing in El Paso to re-fuel due to a storm and we need to go around it. As soon as we start landing, the lights start flickering on and off. So we land, they can\\'t leave the A/C on because they have to shut everything off to re-fuel. We sat on there for an hour or more while they re-fueled, and then not only to tell us we may or may not be going through the storm but the lights were flicking because the LAX crew didn\\'t charge the battery enough and that sucked all the energy so they\\'re needing to trouble shoot that, but we\\'ll be fine and off in a jiffy. One guy yelled \"what\\'s going on?\" and the lady flight attendant literally \"shhhh\"ed him! They kept going into the cockpit with the pilots and coming out with looks on their faces like \"we\\'re screwed\", but they didn\\'t have the decency to tell us anything. When a man asked about what\\'s going on, the male flight attendant said \"well we had to re-fuel to go around the storm, if we go through it, it\\'ll rip these wings right off. I don\\'t think any of us want that do we.\" While we are still sitting on there for who knows how long, the man comes back on and says \"Hey guys we know it\\'s hot but it\\'s just one thing after another, apparently one of the engines isn\\'t working so we\\'re bringing mechanics out to fix it, but it\\'ll be fine.\" So, they finally get sense to let us off the plane, we take our carry-ons and walk off the plane onto the terminal, walk up another set of stairs into the tunnel and sit in the airport, it\\'s about 12:30am at this point. We sit for about an hour without any word from anyone and then a guy from the airport says we\\'re going downstairs to get vouchers \"just in case\" we can\\'t fly tonight. Clearly, no one wants to get on this plane. We stand around waiting for someone to give us vouchers for about 30 mins. They put our luggage in baggage claim so we can go get it. Then they say we\\'ll have a flight at 7am because all others are full and it\\'s on the same plane. We could either stay on cots at the airport or get hotel vouchers, but per the airport all the hotels were full. So the next morning everyone is ready to go at 6:30am, we\\'ve had a good few hours of a nap. 7am rolls around and no plane. The lady from the night before that was telling us of information of flight \"choices\" and so forth comes and says once again \"I work for the airport not the airline, I didn\\'t promise you a flight at 7am.\" When last night, she literally was the one that informed us of everything. So we wait for about an hour plus before a plane that had no one on it magically appears for us to go on. This whole time the airport staff and security was arguing and yelling back and forth at the passengers who were expressing their frustrations. We ended up in SAT 2 hours later than promised but made it home.', 'united airlines The carry on baggage policy is laughable. A bin less than 2/3 of the size of the actual overhead luggage space is used to determine whether it is the right size. And the gate agents decide who they are going to challenge to go through the process of placing your carry ons in their bin. I have never had a problem getting my carry on to fit in the overhead. Traveling with a family of 4, all with properly sized carry ons, the gate agents singled us out and forced us to gate check the bags. There is a reason I never fly United and I was reminded yet again.', 'united airlines I flew with family, total 5 passengers from Shreveport to Miami on October 3rd 2015.

However true to their modus operandi we are here in Houston delayed cause our aircraft is stuck in Wichita. Lord alone knows when we will reach home. United Airlines is operating like a 3rd rate dysfunctional airline during the off season. I shudder to think of it\\'s performance during the holidays.

I had no issues with service as the attendants were friendly and efficient. I had a 15 hour flight from LA to melbourne on a new Boeing 787, which was very clean, seats were comfortable, food was ok, portions were a little small however. Toilets were clean, attendants were friendly and offered water throughout and were quite chatty with customers. My suitcase arrived in one piece.

The treatment he received was horrible! Flight attendant checked his wheelchair although it was stated he needed it for his layover in San Francisco. In San Francisco he was placed by his gate but had no way get to a restroom for over 2 hours. When he arrived in Atlanta, his wheelchair, clearly marked, was used and/or given to another person. He was stranded for over another 2 hours looking for his wheelchair. Fortunately, I made enough noise that his return flight was incident free. Warning, if you are disabled and fly United Airlines make lots of noise to ensure you received the attention you need from staff that work for United. The only reason ground service is receiving a star is because you cannot make it a negative or zero rating.', 'united airlines Took a 12 hour flight from Atlanta to Narita via Denver. The entertainment system for the economy class was broken for the complete duration of flight. On top of that, the reading lights could not be turned on or off and the call attendant button was not working for economy class throughout the flight. The staff was very rude and point blank told us \"What do you gonna do about it?\" There was no attempt made to rectify the situation or pacify customers. Customer service manager on the flight told us that she will reboot the system to try fix the problem, but she did not do anything as my screen was frozen in front of me all the time and showed no signs of system being rebooted. On further enquiring one of the flight attendant revealed that the plane (Boeing 787) had the same problem coming in and since fixing it would mean delaying the flight, they chose not to fix it, or inform us. In fact, when we boarded we could see the entertainment menu but nothing was playing and the staff told us that it will work once we are in air. The flight attendants were seen only when the food service was taking place. They did not bother to do rounds to find out if somebody needed anything as the attendant call button was not working. They just turned off the the cabin lights and disappeared. Just imagine 12 hour flight without entertainment system, reading light, no wifi and broken call button. Cargo was a better option in this flight.', \"united airlines This was my first attempt at flying with United Airlines and I received the worst customer service out of any airline I have flown. First off our flight out of PDX was delayed 6+ hours causing us to miss our connecting flight in Denver.

Once arriving in Seattle we were informed that we were actually waitlisted and did not have seats on their flight. After not being able to get on this flight we went back to the service counter to then again be rerouted. There were no flights until the following day for our destination.

Worst part about this entire ordeal? They won't refund our $1,000 trip that was never had! I have spent the last 2 weeks on trying to get refunded and they only refunded us $150. I can say United's poor customer service and unwillingness for credit or refund has turned me off from never wanting to fly with again. I am very disappointed.\", \"united airlines The United Airlines app is a joke, and they make it impossible for you to check in and receive your boarding passes without uploading your passports to the App. My first time flying international with them this year was in July 2015. We were with a group of 7 people and my poor mom was trying to organize the entire thing by herself. She downloaded the app, and got all of our passports - but it kept saying that it wasn't responding and would shut down. I downloaded it as well, and it did the same thing every single time I tried to upload a passport. She has an iphone, I have a samsung galaxy. This is happening again for my trip tomorrow. I have called United 3 times today and they don't have any way to help me. The App is the only way to check in with your passports if you are flying internationally. This is ridiculous. For a company that is as large as United Airlines, you would think they would want this problem fixed. If this doesn't get resolved, I don't think I will ever fly United ever again. I'm extremely frustrated, and the customer service was no help at all.\", \"united airlines Seattle to Las Vegas via San Francisco with United Airlines. Before heading to the airport I received notice that our flight was a couple hours delayed so they offered to switch our flight. We got new flight info to leave an hour or so after our original flight, and got to the airport to hear our new flight was delayed. We were concerned about missing our connection so we called into customer service, they looked up our info and told us it would be no problem we had plenty of time. Landed in San Francisco for our connection realized how close we were going to be, so we called in again to let them know we were on the plane waiting to get off - so they called the desk to inform them we were coming. They told us they would not hold our connecting flight that we were going to just miss it. At the same time the pilot came on to the intercom to let the other passengers know the connecting flight to Hawaii was being held so they would make it. So you hold some flights but not others. We got off the plane and went to customer service to get a different flight and experienced two of the rudest customer service agents I have encountered - showed zero empathy and were told they wouldn't do anything for us, it was not their fault flights get delayed and that is something that has to be handled through the phone. What is the point of even having customer service at the airport if all they do is tell you to call someone else. So we called in and were told all they could do was submit a form and someone would email me - it has been five days still no email. The agent on the phone informed me that she would give us a seat with more leg room, but the only people that could do it was the customer service at the airport that had already told me they had no ability to help - so went back to the counter and the lady and her manager I spoke to earlier walked away from counter, so they didn't have to speak with me. I explained what happened again and the customer service already told me they had the ability to do it and I was still on the phone if they wanted to talk to them about it. After a deep sigh they moved us up a couple rows so we had more leg room - seriously we had to go through all that for more leg room. If I could give negative stars I would, and suggest people book with someone who will value their time and care if they continue as a customer.\", 'united airlines I will avoid United Airlines in the future. Two long delays on two segments of a two segment trip. Also, United has poor legroom in economy (I\\'ve actually had more comfortable seats in Southwest). Everything is an \"upgrade\" even when there are open seats on the plane. United also discourages checked baggage with $25 fee for first bag and a whopping $40 for second. As a result overhead bins are almost always full requiring you to check carry on at the gate. Because of all the carry on bags, boarding and deplaning is very slow. Airlines pay for time at the gate. The faster they can get people on and off the plane the less it costs them. Every airline should offer 2 free checked bags and allow only one personal item carry on. This would speed up the process greatly.', \"united airlines I will never fly United Airlines again if I can avoid it, and I have not even made it on the plane yet. If you don't log in 24 hours ahead of time, on the dot, you may be forced to upgrade to a Premium Economy or First Class seat, at greatly increased cost. They have no qualms about booking seats they don't have to offer, and then preying on their customers. Fool me once, shame on you.\", \"united airlines I have done 10+ flights this summer many of which have been on United Airlines. Every time I fly it's with the same roller board and the same boot bag for my tall boots (I train horses). Both items are always carried on no problem, the one goes over head and the boots under the seat - except tonight. I was stopped before going through security and told my roller bag was too big. I went to their kiosk across from security where it tuned out the Mobile boarding pass scanner wasn't working so he entered my info twice manually before deciding his system didn't work and I had to go to the desk. Annoyed I went around the corner and moved the jacket into my boot bag so the suitcase would fit in their bin. I went back to security where they didn't even ask to check the size of my bag but then told me my boot bag was too big. Keep in my my friend had gone through security with the same boot bag with her helmet attached to it not 5 minutes before and had not been stopped. Both the manager from United Airlines was incredibly rude as was the security staff. The manager threatened to not let me on the flight - all this over bags that easily fit on the flight and that had both been carried on all of my other United flights including the one to CA 3 days earlier. United is a highly short sighted company with a very poor customer service vision and corporate culture. They don't realize that by ruining a clients experience before they even get on the flight they breed a culture of rudeness. I am normally a model passenger - kind to other passengers, nice to the flight attendants, complimentary to the pilots - after this I have no reason to look at a United Airlines staff member in the eye, clear my trays from the security line, or engage in any kind of pleasantries. I'll for sure be looking to avoid United travel in the future.\", 'united airlines I am yet to find a reason for United Airlines still operating. They obviously hate passengers and the service shows. I booked tickets 1 month in advance and they would not give me seats. They block at least 30 seats and you have to pay more to get an assigned seats and the lowest payment from SEA to IAH was USD69. So on the day of travel, they did give me seats, but me and my wife had to sit 20 rows apart. The staff obviously hate their job or passengers or both. Forget about being helpful, they are downright rude. The best thing to do is not ask for anything and that includes water.', 'united airlines United Airlines serves up sub par service in every respect! Our recent trip back from Amsterdam was ridiculous after our fantastic trip on SWISS. Our cabin was freezing, people were so cold they were wearing winter coats through the entire flight - I only wish I had one! They handed out pathetic flimsy blankets. The food was disgusting pasta thrown to us on disposable plastic trays, and later a freezing cold and disgusting sandwich!', \"united airlines I have read many reviews on United Airlines, many not too favourable. However I flew with United Airlines from Boston to San Francisco. My experience was excellent, on time and the cabin crew were first rate, plane was very clean. Only one small problem, my wife's luggage was offloaded to another flight which arrives about one hour later, no big deal.\", 'united airlines We had full fare United Airlines first class tickets from Cleveland to Los Angeles. The flight departure was over an hour late. The flight is 4.5 hours and there was no in flight entertainment at all. There were not enough of the chicken entree offered to accommodate the 8 passengers in first class, and I had to settle for my second choice. It functioned like an inexpensive no frills airline, while promoting itself as a top tier carrier', 'united airlines I will never fly with United Airlines ever again. We were over two hours late flying because some of the staff were late so we were unable to board. We then had to watch the cabin crew have conversations, instead of letting their customers know what was going on. Although customer service was pretty good, the food was disgusting and the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in. They were worse than budget airline seats. I will never intentionally fly with this company again.', 'united airlines Flight 5353 from MKE to ORD. The United Airlines gate agent at gate E63 in MKE made an announcement on the intercom system that there was a mechanical problem with the plane and the computer system would need to be restarted. Simultaneously ORD was suffering weather delays. The flight left MKE at 8:41, more than an hour late which resulted in missed flights. United Airlines at ORD refused lodging vouchers because the incident was registered as ATC (air traffic control). It is the belief of passengers on the plane that MKE falsified information.', 'united airlines As a Star Alliance Gold member, United Airlines has been my first choice when flying from the States. However my last flight with them from San Francisco to London was rather disappointing. On check-in, the rather rude agent tried to downgrade my paid business ticket to economy due to an apparent overbooking. Only after I called her supervisor did she keep my ticket in business. As there was only 20 minutes till boarding, I had to run to the gate, only just getting on my flight even with TSA priority pass. The flight was operated by an antiquated Boeing 777, it had the old business class layout. The old layout for me is one of the worst due to it\\'s extremely narrow 8 abreast business seating. That\\'s the same as Cathay\\'s premium economy! We departed on time and the flight was smooth. Then, 5 hours into the flight, the entertainment system for the first and business class cabins went kaput. When passengers started pressing the crew call buttons, the Flight Attendants seemed unapologetic and were even borderline rude. One even said \"It\\'s not my fault so stop calling!\" Fortunately, we only had 3 hours left on the flight so, I decided to just get some sleep. We arrived in LHR on time, although that is pretty much the only positive thing I can say about on this flight. I probably will continue to fly United, although they really need to improve their service.', \"united airlines Automated check in at Heathrow, then bag drop, went well. Got the third degree while waiting in line for bag drop (where are you staying, why are you visiting America) as well as the usual check-in questions I had already answered at the machine. Much the same quizzing at the boarding gate. As we entered the aircraft the staff did not bother to check our boarding passes, give directions to our seat, or even smile. Legroom was pretty poor and the seat back in front of me was frayed. The entertainment was okay, some good movies. Screens a little unresponsive. Food tasted good. I asked for coffee and was given water at one point. Once again on exiting the plane no one bothered to say goodbye. I don't think I've ever had such indifferent service on a flight before. I felt like an inconvenience, not a customer. Communications from the captain good, and other than the usual Heathrow 15 minute delay the flight was on time. United Airlines got the job done, but not particularly comfortably or with good service.\", 'united airlines Awful experience with United Airlines. First leg from SFO to IAD delayed by over an hour, but there still were some chances for me to make it for my connecting flight to Dublin. Near IAD, the pilot announced that we needed to wait in the air as both Washington airports had been closed due to \"two incidents\". After another 20 minutes, he informed that we were running out of fuel and need to land in Norfolk, to refuel and head to IAD when it\\'s back open. Hearing this news, one of the passengers had medical emergency and the pilot decided to land on the closed airport anyway. Obviously, half of the passengers have missed their connections and when I finally reached the counter after two hours of waiting, I was rebooked for the next day. And guess what, United Airlines refused to provide hotel voucher as they claimed the delay was due to \"medical emergency\". This was an obvious lie, as medical emergency actually allowed us to land faster on the closed airport and the fellow passengers were livid. The reps mentioned only that \"this is what we see in our system and we can\\'t do anything\". It\\'s absolutely outrageous to use someone\\'s medical emergency as the excuse to get away without facing responsibility for the delay. It\\'s also interesting how our connecting flights were able depart on time if the airport was closed. The seats were quite comfy, the inflight service was virtually non-existent.', \"united airlines This was my first experience with United Airlines in probably 10 years or so, and I promise it will be my last. The flight from Savannah to Washington D.C. was awful. First sign of terrible service began on arrival at terminal check in. Every one of their systems were down. My sisters flight was no where to be found. Being frequent flyers we arrived early and it took 45 minutes to locate all our tickets and get us on our way. Lady was nice but by no means cordial in the way other customer service reps are. Our flight was delayed and upon arrival we missed our connecting flight to Munich. I know this happens and obviously causes frustration. However, this was only the start of it all. No flights were available until the following day. I am writing this review from the hotel in real time. When asked if we would be reimbursed for the hotel or upgraded for our inconvenience the rep literally laughed in my face and said that isn't our problem. I have never been more angry with a rep in my entire life. I spent 2 hours trying to call customer service and to my dismay was only able to speak to someone who clearly had just learned English a few months prior. Unbelievable disregard for customer satisfaction. As a Delta sky miles member I will never betray my airline again (this international flight was cheaper through United. Not worth the 350 dollar savings). I honestly can't comprehend with human logic how this company still exists. I am appalled and will never ever give 1 dollar to United Airlines again. I have never written a review for anything before. That tells you how livid I am with this sham of a company, if you can even call it that.\", 'united airlines Every time I have to fly United Airlines I dread it. At least they were consistent. I just donâ€™t understand why they donâ€™t get it. Boeing 767-400 is old and looks old. They serve welcome champagne in plastic cups. The 2-1-2 seats are cramped, especially when youâ€™re trying to sleep. I intentionally took the centre single seat, although I always sit by the window, for I didnâ€™t want to be stepping over unknown people when heading for the bathroom. The colors of the interior are drab and dull - gray and mute blue. Could they not at least add some colorful dinnerware or napkins or blankets or pillow. Spice up the cabin. I will say that the meal options have improved. The dinner menu was rather good. Midway through the flight I had asked a FA when will United get rid of their 767â€™s for they are old planes. The one we were flying on was 15 years old. I hope that United will bring back the joy and luxury of flying some day. It would really make me smile and not dread flying them.', 'united airlines Dreadful with all four United Airlines flights delayed (Los Angeles to Roatan via Houston). Computers down in Roatan, so they handwrote luggage labels and boarding passes - no backup?? Passengers were still boarding 1 hour after we were due to leave. United Airlines premium economy was a con as only first row has extra leg room and seats same as economy, and also charged for food! First flight delayed, told us after due to board then 2nd plane has maintenance problem too, so further delays. Was told 4 times on Roatan flight that agents waiting for us to help with connections as a lot of passengers had. No one at Houston and they did not get us forward in queues to get connections when other passengers were on later flights so had more time! We were told plane to LAX was waiting for us, so get to gate quick - arrived to be told had left. Only decent staff was lady who sorted new connection flight. Disgraceful company, four flights and four delays.', 'united airlines San Francisco to Sydney with United Airlines, and stunningly horrendous service in GlobalFirst. I have traveled in economy on foreign airlines that provide better service than what this flight delivered. The seat was dirty and worn. No sleep topper was provided, nor pajamas like other airline First class provides. The pre-departure drink was served in a plastic cup! The menu had 3 entree selections for a 14 hour flight - all disgusting with heavy cream sauces to mask the inedible food. Not even a wine list was provided, in first class on a $12,000 ticket! The extremely senior cabin crew were out of shape and very uninterested in providing service, with one banging into my seat throughout the flight. Lavatory was absolutely disgusting - never once did a flight attendant attempt to keep it tidy. Breakfast was a joke - two choices and lucky to get a banana with my cereal! Juice was canned concentrate. Not even cappuccino or espresso. How does United Airlines pass this embarrassment off and justify the ticket price on such a high profile route?', 'united airlines I made a last minute booking from LAX to FRA via SFO but then truly regretted choosing this airline. LAX-SFO was without any problem. Plane departed on time and arrived to SFO 15 minutes earlier but we waited 20 minutes as all gates were busy. However the SFO-FRA leg was one of my worst long haul flight experience. Starting from IFE to food everything had some sort of problem. For 11 hours flight, the seats are not equipped with seat-back screens. If you you want to entertain yourself only way is to to pay and purchase internet. So I did, but this time after few hours all my devices run out of energy but plug did not work under the seat. Food was just ok. Shortly after take off cabin crew delivered cracks and after about 1.5 half dinner was served. I decided to have chicken but it tasted like nothing. Friendliness of cabin crew was non-existent. Seats were dirty and exhausted. Plane itself looked quite old indeed. Overall experience is very very poor. Never fly with this airline ever again. If you can afford it, avoid United especially for long haul flights.', 'united airlines Thought I had stepped into the dark ages on the United Airlines flights. Seats are cramped and dirty, on old aircraft. Entertainment system on central/aisle screens and no Seatback monitors. Food can often be poor in economy class, but this was barely edible. United Airlines is the only international airline I have flown recently that charges for drinks in Economy. Drinks prices are certainly not at duty free levels, and were higher than land based prices in some cases. At least beer and wine was gratis! The flight was overbooked, and they were offering vouchers to take another flight. But we arrived in one piece. The whole outfit United Airlines needs a shake up.', \"united airlines I traveled with United Airlines from Veracruz Mexico to Houston onboard a small Embraer 145. The flight was okay, but the aircraft (maybe old) was in a really bad condition. Very dirty and very damaged cabin. I don't know why this aircraft was in such a bad condition, but I will give them a small rating due to this aircraft condition. Also, they require you to pay for the drinks.\", \"united airlines I've flown United Airlines many times, mostly domestic. They've been equally bad each time, but this flight bothered me more since it was a long flight. And maybe I've been spoiled by other good airlines that operate US-Asia routes. The plane looked a little old. Seats were pretty small (for reference, I'm 158cm tall). The entertainment screen looked like one from 20 years ago: touch screen, but you press five times and it still goes to the wrong button. However, they had a decent selection of movies and shows. I tried to play a movie but it kept freezing every five minutes. At first I thought it was just mine who had problems, so I pushed the call button for a flight attendant. 30 minutes later, no sign of any flight attendant, I gave up and already prepared to sleep for the remaining 12 hours of the flight. It turned out later, it was an issue with the whole entertainment system on that flight. After they reset the system, which took another 20 minutes, mine worked ok, but I know I was one of those lucky ones. The food onboard was terrible. I was pretty hungry but still didn't finish any of the meals they gave me. Well, they got me to Tokyo in one piece, so at least there's that. Bottom line: don't fly with United Airlines if you have/can afford other options.\", 'united airlines United Airlines have nil customer service. My son was booked to fly Sydney to LA. Flight cancelled due to mechanical issues (it happens) and all moved to Qantas flight. Excess luggage charge was higher with Qantas, but United Airlines advised they would reimburse the difference. On return flight my sons credit card would not work for same issue (excess luggage) - a friend of his paid. However on his return $100 had been withdrawn by United Airlines?

We ask them if this is the gate for our United Airlines flight to Houston and they say yes. All the seats in the gate are full, so we sit across from that gate. At the last minute they make us go from gate 84 to 71 (which is really far). Then they say that the flight is overbooked by 8 seats and ask for 8 volunteers. We are a family of 6 and decide to volunteer and have to wait in line for 20 minutes - abandoning this when they say they don\\'t need volunteers. When we board, they say that will change all our seats because the plane got switched and we are a party of 6, and none of our seats are together - not even in the same row! I was traveling with a teenager, my husband and 3 young kids. One was 8, one was 7, and one only 4. The person that checked the boarding pass said to ask the agent to make our seats together. The agent is rude and didn\\'t help us. When we get on the plane we all have to sit seperately. When we ask staff if it is okay to switch our seats so at least someone can sit together, the crew tells us to sit down and stay in the seats that they gave us. I end up sitting \"near\" (not next to) my 4 year old and next to my 6 year old. My husband sits 3 rows back near my 8 year old. My teenager has to sit alone with strangers, 4 rows back.

Coming to the food, well don't expect much, they have very limited options - only the salad is nice rest we liked nothing. Infant, this was the worst flight food we ever had.

I will not bore you with the details of misinformation that caused us to miss our first flight only to be wait listed and after waiting 4 hours discover that we had been misinformed again and the flight was oversold - which means we never stood a chance of getting on that flight! It was the last flight out and after witnessing the drama of 3 people with tickets being told they were not going home that night, we went home with tickets for the next day. We were told to be at the gate an hour early. My complaint is about the lack of concern for the comfort of the passengers. On our flight out it was warm for the entire flight. I requested that the air be adjusted and was told by the steward that he \"would look into it\". It never improved but I decided to just ignore it. However, on the flight back the whole trip was very warm - even with full air on it never cooled down. I asked the steward to please have the air lowered and he said \"he would look into it\" after another hour I walked through the cooler first class section and asked a different steward to make our cabin cooler and guess what, he said \"I\\'ll look into it\". The cabin never became comfortable and several folks mentioned as they deplaned how hot the flight was! The attitude I picked up was we (the paying passengers) were just cargo that needed to be loaded - secured - and unloaded. Our comfort during the flight was a non-issue and the response they uniformally gave spoke of training of redirection and not of any effort to adjust anything.

It was depressing to see a great US company perform so badly.', 'united airlines The worst experience ever. I flew United Airlines first class from Orlando to San Francisco and back. There are a number of issues that made me really unhappy - I am a frequent flyer, pay for my flights (no upgrades) and I am certainly not a complainer, but this was just too much. The airplane was not clean, there were stains on my seat, the back rest of the seat in front of me and on the table. This was already bad, but to top it off - there is no more inflight entertainment on United flights. When I say this I mean no more tv screens and headphones. United Airlines apparently took out all their entertainment hardware and replaced it with their new inflight entertainment - here is how that goes: you have to bring your own personal device and your own headphones. Then you have to lock into their wifi system at which point you can choose from their entertainment options. In first class wifi is free, but you have to pay in coach. So here is my issue with that: I do not have a personal device, all I have is a laptop and a phone. I certainly do not want to watch a movie on my tiny phone screen and did not bring a charging cable for my laptop. So I had no entertainment on a 5 hour flight. This is ridiculous. What about the travelers who do not have a PD? Congratulations United, - you found another way to rip off your customers.', \"united airlines I will never fly United Airlines again!

I feel sure we will miss our connecting flight once again.\", 'united airlines San Francisco to Bozeman Yellowstone International with United Airlines was one of the worst travel experiences that I have had. All of the flights were either late or got changed and we did not receive a new itinerary. They recognized that it was their fault so they put us up for the night. Little did we know that we were given a voucher for 1 room with a full bed and a pull out couch for 5 people. To add insult to injury when talking with a customer service agent I was offered $50 per ticket for the hassle. I told them that that was a \"slap in the face\". I then requested a management call back. I have been waiting over a month for that call and when I finally call am told that I need to call the customer service line and leave a message. Great service United - maybe this is why you have such a low rating.', 'united airlines London to Chicago return. Having had a brilliant United Airlines outward flight 5 days previously, I had no reason to expect any different on the return trip. However,it was a totally different experience. The seats were smaller and less legroom, I wish I could remember which type of aircraft it was. The seatback screens were tiny and had less choice. The meal was disgusting apart from the icecream and for breakfast we were offered a cold (almost frozen) croissant. My main issue though was the crew member who \\'served\\' me. She never cracked a smile once. Nor any interaction at all apart from \"chicken or pasta\" and a very interrogative \"drink?\" She did neither greet or farewell any passengers and treated us like an inconvenience. However on departing the plane which had an exceptionally smooth landing at LHR the pilot bade us farewell and thanked us for flying United Airlines - I guess he\\'s the one that really matters.', 'united airlines Orlando to Portland with United Airlines, the second time this year I have flown Business class on United. Hope I never have to do so again. The lunch which was supposed to be served was announced as \"We will be serving snacks on this flight.\" A quick pass through by a totally disinterested flight attendant offering a tray of tiny bags of potato chips. On a previous flight they ran out of a breakfast selection after only taking four orders. The staff lacked any real interest in their passengers both times. There was a definite feeling that we were intruding on their time. I don\\'t need a lot of service, but a touch of interest would be nice, instead of having to listen to the Attendants have lengthy personal chats in the galley.', \"united airlines My flight with United Airlines from Los Angeles to Saipan and back was a terrible experience. Both directions we had mechanicals that delayed the flight overnight in one case, and 11 hours in the next. In rebooking my flight from Narita to San Francisco it resulted in my being up for 20 hours waiting. I am currently sitting wait for my flight to leave and don't have the faith that it will. My flight from Guam on a Boeing 737 had only one bathrrom open for economy class. There was a line to use the restroom half way down the plane. When the seat belt sign went on everyone ignored it in order to keep their place in line. No flight attendant even tried to get people to sit down. If I can help it, I will never fly United Airlines again.\", 'united airlines United Airlines kept us waiting 12 hours before cancelling the flight from Milan to Newark. Nobody from United Airlines did ever show up. The matter was handled only by the airport staff. We were offered a 200 USD bonus we could use \"only if\" reserving a future flight with United Airlines. Never ever again with this airline.', \"united airlines We boarded our aircraft early for our 09.25 flight to New York for our 4 day break. At 09.10 we were told there was a technical problem. We sat on the plane for over 4 hours with only 2 crackers and half a glass of water served. Eventually we were told to leave the plane and ground staff would give us further instructions. The ground staff hadn't even been told we were leaving the plane. Eventually after collecting our luggage we were put on a bus to an awful hotel. We were collected by bus the following morning and taken back to the airport. A member of staff was handing out airline compensation forms, but when we asked if the plane was fixed, she snapped not to harass her as she had worked a double shift and was stressed. When we said we were stressed and just wanted to know if we would be travelling that day, she called over security who threatened if there was any problems, he controlled who got on the plane and who didn't. Disgraceful behaviour to everyone who were now delayed 24 hours. We eventually arrived in New York 26 hours late and in rush hour, so our 4 days was reduced to 2! United Airlines have since sent an email offering compensation but the 2nd page with all the information was missing so none the wiser but I'm guessing judging by previous reviews it will be a travel voucher. After emailing them they now seen unaware of our plight. Wouldn't recommend United Airlines to anyone.\", 'united airlines I flew with United Airlines four times in one week, two of the flights were overbooked. This is ridiculous. They offer compensation in airline credits and a food voucher for your inconvenience, meaning they suffer no consequences by overbooking flights. This was discouraging the first time, but having experienced this twice in one week is unacceptable. United Airlines has lost my business and I will discourage others from flying with them.', \"united airlines This was a 12 hour flight with United Airlines from Hong Kong to San Francisco and we got a small meal 1 hour into the flight and small tray of food with an hour of the flight left. Besides that they didn't come around with snacks or drinks. The food was bad, neither one of us could finish it. The seats are very uncomfortable for any flight but especially for 12 hours. I had requested a seat before leaving on the trip, but when I went to check in I didn't get the aisle seat that I had picked, but the inside seat in the last row of the plane. On my flights from San Francisco to Denver and Denver to Fargo we didnt get snacks and barely got a drink. This is in comparison to Air Niugini who I flew to Hong Kong with who were excellent.\", 'united airlines United Airlines give no preference to frequent flyers and provide an abysmal excuse for customer service. They sat our entire family apart from one another although the reservations were made together. I called about 2 weeks ahead of the flight to ensure we were seated together, and was assured that our seat preferences were noted. I checked in online 24 hours in advance and when I got to the baggage drop at the airport the rude check in assistant informed me that I hadn\\'t checked in, and therefore hadn\\'t been allocated a seat. I produced the email noting my check in time to which he responded, \"that must have been a technical error.\" I was pretty much in disbelief of how rude every representative we dealt with was. Before taking a long haul flight with United Airlines I would also take into consideration that they don\\'t provide hot meals, just pretzels and small snacks. Also no in flight entertainment on an 11 hour flight. I fly to London twice a year and will never make the mistake of taking a United Airlines flight again. Overall completely disappointing experience.', 'united airlines I haven\\'t flown United Airlines in a while and I don\\'t plan on using them again anytime soon. Our luggage was the same weight (give or take 5lbs) heading to San Francisco from Hartford as it was going from San Francisco to Hartford but we paid $100 more when checking our luggage on our way home. Note the price difference was not due to being in a different weight class, even though our luggage did fluctuate by 7lbs when placed on the same scale 2 different times within mere minutes. On our way home I was excited to see TVs on the back of each seat which faded quickly as soon as I realized I couldn\\'t watch a single thing unless I swiped my credit card. Sorry any motivation I would have had to shell out $7.99 to watch any kind of entertainment was obliterated by having to pay $125 for 1 check bag for both my husband and I. Our connecting flight departure time was changed numerous times due to \"awaiting aircraft\". Ending in over an hour delay. No thank you United Airlines, I did not enjoy our experience together and will not be using United Airlines again.', \"united airlines I flew United Airlines from LHR to MCO via IAH in Economy Plus, on their Boeing 787-8. United Airlines Economy Plus product is simply the economy class seat but with an additional 3 or so inches of leg room. The economy plus product is only worth buying if you want that extra room but in my opinion I don't believe there's much difference between that and the economy product. I flew economy back and didn't really find it much different. My wife, son and I are all average height and weight so don't require any extra leg room. The main problem is that the seat is far too thin and as such doesn't provide much support. I know this is a design improvement to lower the weight of the aircraft, but it doesn't help your back on those long flights - LHR to IAH is 10 hours or so. I normally fly business class for work for transatlantic flights (SFO and JFK) around four or five times a year on BA's 747-400 or Virgin's A346 or 747-400 and flying the 787-8 is by far the best craft I've been on. I felt the freshest and the least dehydrated on this craft. In summary, I don't think economy plus is worth the upgrade cost but if you have an extra $150 dollars or so then go for it.\", 'united airlines This seems almost pointless. United Airlines couldn\\'t careless about my family while speaking on the phone, so it is hard to believe they would take the time to check their reviews. This is a fluid matter and we expect to fly tomorrow, but I have serious doubts. We are traveling with a 14 month old, a 5 year old and a 7 year old, and we paid extra so that we could sit together and received confirmation to that affect. This was done two months ago. Today, the day before the flight, we received a \"check in\" email but when attempting this, the seats were scattered and the five year old was not even reflected to be on the plane. Needless to say, we called Customer Service and after an hour long phone call they could not or would not correct their admitted errors and admitted to charging us for something they then took away without notice. They suggested we handle this at the gate tomorrow. I have zero confidence. Traveling with kids is difficult enough, but enduring the childlike behavior from United Airlines is pathetic. So since this matter is still fluid and United Airlines has an opportunity to read their reviews, and perhaps correct their errors, I put them to the challenge. If they correct it, I will go out of my way to amend this rating. If they do not, I will follow up accordingly.', 'united airlines I have come not to expect too much of airlines with all the skimping they have done, however United Airlines takes they apathy or even dislike of the customer to a whole new level. I took the same trip over Christmas last year. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. In the end, I got a $100 voucher to use exclusively on United.com to buy a ticket. I didn\\'t use it. United.com is ridiculously overpriced. I went again in the summer thinking one bad trip can\\'t color my perception of United Airlines. This time it was just as awful and all the calls I made prior to flying to avoid the same issues were treated as an annoyance. However, when things went poorly and my child\\'s stroller was lost, they were dismissive and eventually \"escalated\" it to give me another $100 voucher. It\\'s been 6 weeks since I returned and apparently they are still \"looking\" for the stroller and I shouldn\\'t call back before another 5 weeks!', 'united airlines United Airlines flight From Milan to Newark was not bad. When my son arrived in EWR, his connecting flight had been canceled, so he was rerouted through Chicago. At Chicago, his flight to MCI was cancelled, so he was stuck in Chicago overnight. United Airlines did nothing to remedy the situation.', 'united airlines San Francisco to Taipei return with United Airlines. Being a vegetarian is not easy class when travelling, but most airlines provide vegetarian meals, however with few choices for international flights. I am allergic to curry, which I contacted United Airlines after my outbound flight\\'s 2 curry meals. I told the customer services to please indicate my allergy to curry. To my luck, I got two curry meals again on the return flight. I have learned that my allergy was recorded on their data bank. In this high speed communication era, I could be easily contacted via e-mail or call if my \"allergy issues\" can\\'t be accommodated. I could have brought my own food for this cross pacific flight. What will it take for United Airline to be serious about \"food allergy\" issues?', 'united airlines The first leg out of Buffalo was rather enjoyable, the plane was clean and rather new. However, United Airlines new \"slimline\" seating wasn\\'t pleasant, but EconomyPlus made up for it. Service was basic, with complimentary beverages. Entertainment was DirecTV, but it was useless on an hour flight. The plane arrives early to O\\'Hare. The United Club at C Terminal was okay, offering decent food and WiFi. The 737-700 to Bozeman was not what I had in mind. It wasn\\'t very clean and had some trash in the seat pockets. The cloth seats didn\\'t help either. But EconomyPlus at the bulkhead offered extra comfort, and the DirecTV was enjoyable, however movies weren\\'t on-demand. The flight arrived on-time to Bozeman with a gorgeous approach. My bag was the first one at the claim, and I ended up enjoying my experience with United Airlines and couldn\\'t wait to explore Yellowstone and Grant Teton National Parks.', 'united airlines My 84-year-old recently widowed mother, who was moving to the Portland area, was charged $100 by United Airlines for being 9 lbs over the weight limit of 50 lbs on her checked bag - which she had already paid $25 to check in. Unlike younger travelers, who may have considered carrying the extra 9 lbs, she was not able to do so. With less an hour before her flight was scheduled to take off, we were in no position to argue about United Airlines extortion of money from customers. They should be ashamed of themselves, but instead I received 2 responses from their customer service stating essentially, too bad, you should have made a bigger scene at the counter.', \"united airlines The most uncaring, unhelpful airline that I have ever had the displeausure to travel on, left at least a hundred people stranded at an airport with no offer of hospitality or any other necessity including food or lodging. Furthermore instead of inviting us to join the sleeping travelers in a perfectly hospitable suite they decided to make up a flimsy excuse that we couldn't spend the night their because we would interrupt the slumbers of the first class, and they made their intentions clear that us, lowly ecomony traveler's were to spend the night on the airport floor, in light of their recent mistakes, not just to us but to multiple people, I would advise that any travelers would refrain from using United Airlines until they decide to actually start caring about their passangers.\", \"united airlines I had read and heard a lot of negative reviews about United Airlines but since I work in customer service decided to give them a shot knowing that people usually don't say when they've had an okay experience or average or a fantastic one. Unfortunately I did find out that those reviews were quite true, I was traveling from SD to Chicago IL and my flight was delayed by a whole hour and 40 minutes, and the delays continued throughout the whole trip from Chicago IL, to Houston Tx, from Houston Tx to El Salvador. You had to buy snacks and pay if you wanted to see a movie/TV? This has been the first and last time I'll use United Airlines, just horrible overall experience. I'd rather pay more for a different airline than fly United Airlines again.\", 'united airlines I had the misfortune to choose United for our holiday and I would never fly with them again. The plane was so dated and old that there was no back of seat entertainment, only a selection of films and TV on the big screen. This is ridiculous for a 10 hour flight in the 21st century. Whilst queuing to board, an employee gave us some leaflets about \"Personal Device Entertainment\" ie you can download their selection of films etc via the UA app. The impression we were given was that this was not instead of seat back screens, but was an additional courtesy service. The colleague also told us that \"it was probably too late to download the app now, but here\\'s the details anyway.\" Appalling. As a result I had a mobile phone with very little battery life (no inflight chargers), no time to download an app, and no internet access (available for an additional 17USD, which is not far off what I pay for a whole month\\'s WiFi). I had my young son with me, for whom much of the big screen entertainment was unsuitable (House MD, Aloha, some dreadful programme about how money affects our psyche). It was the longest most boring and uncomfortable flight I have ever had. Don\\'t get me started on United Airlines food. They had three options on our previous flight on the way out, but only one left- chicken and potatoes, but without the potatoes. The rest of the food was barely edible, with semi frozen bread rolls and synthetic over packaged over processed snacks in several layers of cellophane that could probably last five years without refrigeration. This airline is a joke and happily takes your money whilst treating you with contempt. Never, ever again.', \"united airlines This is the third, and last time, I will ever fly United long haul, short haul, or any haul. Absolutely the worst airline I have flown. The flight from SGN to HKG was ok, mercifully it is a short flight. The cabin is small and slightly uncomfortable but I can live with that for a couple of hours. The flight from HGK to Chicago, though, is a nightmare. Dirty aircraft, in-flight entertainment doesn't work properly, and the FAs are rude and condescending. They missed me, and this is the second time actually, while serving dinner. When I pointed it out I was met with a smirk and the FA basically tossed a cold dinner on my tray. I really hate this airline and will never fly it again. I simply don't understand why they can't take a few 'hints' from the Asian carriers and learn a lesson or two.\", 'united airlines I just got home from what was a horrible experience and an unfortunate way to end such a pleasant vacation with my family. Our flight out of Cancun was delayed and we waited in the airport for 9 hours without internet and no idea what was going on. They did not communicate with us what was happening and the flight just kept getting delayed. Finally all the passengers decided to find out what was going on. We had to wait 4 hours in line to be able to talk to someone. Everyone on that flight missed their connecting flights out of Houston. The airline offered us 7$ each to get something to eat, which is ridiculous. We had to spend the night and ended up getting home 15 hours after we were supposed to. Their customer service is terrible, they could have done a lot more to accommodate their customers.', \"united airlines United Airlines no longer offers a bereavement discount. They are the only airline to offer a non-stop flight from SFO-PIT to attend a funeral and they won't discount a ridiculously, priced last-minute fare.Thanks, but no thanks for the condolences United.

We flew out with Air Canada and flew back in with United Airlines. The United Airlines aircraft was really dated, shocked when we entered the plane. The inflight entertainment I rate 1/10, the food served I rate 3/10. The flight itself was smooth but overall we were not impressed at all. The children had a good experience with Air Canada, they were able to charge their phones on the flight, Air Canada inflight entertainment was also very good. Our conclusion is that we won't fly United Airlines again after today's experience. Good luck to whoever does!\", 'united airlines I have taken buses that were better equipped for long travel. This was shockingly bad. The \"entertainment\" on a 12+ hour flight from Chicago to Tokyo consisted of failed TV pilots and box office duds. If you wanted to watch anything decent you had to download their app which was impossible as the wifi kept cutting out after less than a minute. They offer web service for $17.00 which was suggested to me to try in order to watch the \"free\" movies. Classic ambush. They charge you for food in between the free meals which were over 9 hours apart. Just a brutal experience. Staff were passable but weren\\'t good enough to compensate. Never again.', 'united airlines I was a little bit concerned of booking on UA after reading some of the reviews. No reason for concern, however. Took a flight from Amsterdam to Houston with a connection to Salt Lake City. Flew back from San Diego to Houston with connection to Amsterdam. Legroom on the domestic US flights a bit limited but no complaints while flying over the Atlantic. Had an almost two hour delay on the flight from Houston to Amsterdam of which we where informed already quite early and about which we received several updates. Made up some of the time during the flight. Cabin staff were friendly and catered to all of our needs with no exception. Food and drinks in adequate quantity. Quality not different from what I have experienced with most other airlines. This was the first time I flew with United and I have no reason not to fly with them again.', 'united airlines We ordered the flights a month before and when we got to the airport they switched our airplane to a smaller one so put us all in different seats. You have to pay $7.99/hr to watch regular cable and Internet is $3.99/hr and you can only visit aa.com. Next time will pay $10 more and fly Delta.', 'united airlines I have flown quite a lot this year with multiple trips to Asia and Europe. Mostly on United because I get free upgrades to economy plus due to my frequent flyer status. I am quite tall so I need the extra leg room. However, I have to say most of the planes I got to fly in were very old, some with zero back of the seat entertainment (especially on flights from Chicago to Asia) and those that had back of the seat entertainment were on tiny screens where the films were looped. I cant figure out why United flies these poor planes on their long haul routes. In addition, the food on this airline is extremely bad - especially the breakfast.', \"united airlines Left house at 10am for airport for a flight at 2pm. The flight was delayed an hour, and then another hour to look at the nose of their plane. Then they cancelled the flight and had to put me on a flight out of LAX instead. Instead of a couple of hours of traveling time, United Airlines made it a 12 hour travel day. A little girl was crying her eyes out, because she wouldn't make it to something very important. I understand that flights get cancelled, but they were not courteous nor expedient. No reimbursement or anything, if I had been late to something also, I would be doing much more than just a bad review.\", 'united airlines First flight Manchester to Philadelphia was super, plenty of seat space and all family seated together, cabin crew attentive supplying complimentary drinks and food. Entertainment was great, TV in back of seat with multiple options for TV, movies or music, plenty to keep the kids occupied during a 7+ hour flight and airline provided ear buds. Philadelphia to San Francisco there was no entertainment (6+ hour flight), complimentary drinks and snacks, cabin space was ok. Given no entertainment, this flight seemed longer than expected.', 'united airlines Pilot and flight attendants were excellent, but the staff at Miami airport were rude, unfriendly and unhelpful.

In addition to that, one of the staff yelled at us when we tried to talk to him about our delayed flight.', 'united airlines My family and I spent the last few weeks preparing for my fathers new job in the Marshal Islands (Kwajalein). We were ready for our flight, which was supposed to depart at 6am. We were there an hour early. We had our tickets, confirmation numbers, all the paperwork. As we checked in, the staff member at the counter said we weren\\'t on the flight. After 45 min of sitting and arguing they finally decided to honor the tickets (that were already paid for), but they said we couldn\\'t make the 6.00 flight, because it was leaving in 10 min.

Hopefully the plane is decent.', 'united airlines I was on flight UA1538 scheduled to depart EWR today 8/23/15 to West Palm Beach. My experience was nothing short of horrendous. I, along with many of the passengers on this flight, were appalled at the lack of customer service and communication regarding this flight. We boarded and deplaned twice over a 3 hour span due to mechanical problems, first waiting to see if there was another plane available or if the plane could be fixed, until it was declared that the flight was cancelled. Employee at the gate got said \"your flight is cancelled, go to customer service.\" No other information was given, no concierge came to speak with us, we were on our own with no other information about where to go, the luggage, departing flight alternatives, procedures, overnight accomodations, nothing. I asked a baggage handler what happened to our luggage, he said it would come off at carousel 9. Carousel 9 was under construction and another baggage personel told us that the bags were going on another flight to West Palm ahead of us. They put a call in to get my luggage and said, go to carousel 8. After another hour and a half later, the bags were still not there. Over a 5 hour span, there was no customer service to address any issues. I finally tracked down my luggage and proceeded to customer service to get an alternative flight. I was told everything was booked until the following evening. My friends looked online and found a few sooner flights with JetBlue. I finally got another flight reservation at 11.30 tomorrow morning, a connecting flight that will now take me 5.5 hours to fly a 2.5 hour route. I am amazed at the miscommunication and complete lack of compensation or customer attention afforded by United. Their personnel had no idea of anything, we all got different answers to the same questions and felt completely abandoned by United.', \"united airlines My family and I were flying from London to Hawaii via Los Angeles. It was a 10 hour and 20 minute flight to Los Angeles and we were given only one meal. However on this particular aircraft we were given inflight entertainment which was brilliant. You could watch films, TV shows, Music videos, play games, all sorts, and they could be paused and rewinded. However the flight from LA to Honolulu was terrible. This was a 5 hour flight and we were given no food, food was available to buy but it basically cost an arm and a leg. There was inflight entertainment but you had to pay a ridiculous amount of money for it. On our 5 hour flight from Honolulu to San Francisco we were, again, given no food, however this time the inflight entertainment was free and was very good. On our flight from San Francisco back to London Heathrow, which was another 11 hour flight, we were given no inflight entertainment whatsoever. Not even a screen. There were communal screens, but what they were showing wasn't necessarily what everybody wanted to watch. It certainly wasn't what I wanted to watch. Overall I felt the flight attendant service was poor. They don't seem to be aware of their passengers. On many occasions when the attendant came by with a bin bag to collect the rubbish, we were just ignored, they didn't even turn to us to see if we had anything that needed putting in the bin. The seats were relatively comfortable but there was very little leg room. But all aircrafts were clean. Every flight that we were on departed late. It was my first time flying with United Airlines and, overall, I was very disappointed and will not be flying with them again.\", \"united airlines This was my first time flying United and I was a little apprehensive given the number of negative reviews. I did some searching in the internet prior to departing and found they use the 767-300 on the LHR-ORD route. A 25 year old 767. It shows. The cabin is extremely dated. One fellow passenger described the IFE as being like a 'sat nav' which I thought was an accurate description. Tiny, low def screen with no touch screen on demand facilities. Just films and music in a loop. I did like the ATC channel, however. The food was horrible. I know airline food is never great but I'll eat anything so it must have been bad. Additional snacks had to paid for. The crew were decent. They were polite and happy. I've flown transatlantic a fair few times and have found Delta, Virgin and BA all deliver a better service on nicer planes.

We were also given a snacks and drinks after takeoff and before landing. The inflight entertainment was also really good. There was a wide range of movies, shows, games, and music.

There had been a 4 hour delay travelling to Orlando due to technical issues and on our return journey 3 weeks later (20th Aug) there had been worse delays. Unfortunately a passenger took ill and an emergency landing was necessary to assist. Most passengers ended up sleeping in the airport, some with children. The airport was cold and we requested blankets however no response was offered re this request. The airline refused to assist with accomodation or vouchers for food, although before we landed the pilot informed passengers that those connecting would be assisted in this manner. The supervisor or service director, as called in the States, was so contentious and disrespectful towards passengers and made a comment saying that the pilot had no 'idea what he was talking about' regarding assistance with accomodation etc. This clearly showing lack of professionalsm on the part of the supervisor and lack of skills in overall customer services displayed by staff. No information had been shared with passengers and after queing for over 2 hours were told that our option would be to spend the rest of the morning (as it was 2am) in the airport. To top it off the next morning our flight was also delayed by almost 3 hours due to mechanical problems. I will not recommend this airline.\", 'united airlines Flight was cancelled (not weather related) and no announcement was given on the cancellation and then no direction or assistance given thereafter.

I was cold (no blankets to be found, apparently you have to request them) and luckily we had our own headphones as no headphones were passed out. There were no waters given for a five and a half hour flight as on other airlines we fly and the flight attendants only came through for drink requests once before the flight left and once during dinner service, other times I had to request refills of my water. I am surely not looking forward to my return flight this weekend.', \"united airlines I recently flew to Mexico with United Airlines, the first flight wasn't bad, the crew was friendly and quick (it was a very small plane) and the seats were comfortable with lots of leg room.

My son (3 years old) received the ordinary meals and he did not like it. Our flight had 2 crew members for all of the economy section (for both Economy Plus and regular Economy). Food took forever to roll out and the beverage service was even longer. I bought 2 seats (1 for my 3 year old child and another for my 10 month old). I told United (on the phone, at the customer service desk, and also at the check-in desk) that when the child car seats are put into the plane seats, the person in the front cannot recline for their 7 hour flights. Each and every time they said they did not have the power to move me to the bulkhead. I accepted and sure enough this caused some frustration for the person who couldn't recline - and this happened on both the outgoing and incoming flights. I will fly anyone other than United.\", \"united airlines I flew a round trip from Detroit to LAX with a connecting flight each way. There was a delay for all of the 4 planes I flew on, and on the way there, there was a 2 hour delay. On the way back, there was a 1 hour delay and we sat in the plane while they fixed the air conditioning, and it was incredibly hot. I understand that they had to fix the plane's air conditioning, but they should have done that before we got on the plane and had to sit in that heat for an hour. Then I missed my connecting flight, and I got on a new flight (after talking to a very rude lady at customer service), and that flight was delayed because they didn't have any flight attendants for that plane, so they had to wait over an hour until they could get a new flight crew to come. I had an absolutely miserable experience with United for all 4 of my flights with them, and I will never fly with United again.\", 'united airlines I was very disappointed and astonished about the IFE. Some seats have no windows, there are no seat-back VOD (video on-demand) screens, or even AOD (audio on demand). No music, no personal screen, nothing. Instead, United Airlines thinks they can satisfy customers by putting super tiny full cabin projectors, virtually impossible to see clearly from a window (in this case \"wall\") seat that is farthest away from the screen, and play movies on them. I was okay with the movie selections, but little kids see this too, and most are PG-13. Very cramped seats with minimal recline made the trip even more uncomfortable. The Wi-Fi was not good either. Food was the ordinary stuff you get from United Airlines. Bathrooms take way too long to wait for, wherever you go. There are lines everywhere. Staff weren\\'t very kind either. I will definitely avoid United Airlines Boeing 747s, if not United Airlines itself.', \"united airlines Coming back with my girlfriend, her daughter, and her daughter's friend - our original flight was canceled. We were then booked on different flights - I mean 3 of us were booked on one flight and one of the 15 year old girls were booked on a separate flight. We called to correct this and were booked together on a flight, but when we got to the gate they had only 3 seats! Thus, I had to send the women ahead of me, even though the only adult had really never flown, is afraid of planes, and was nearly in tears going onto the plane. Not to mention that I am their only way home once they get to their destination. I talked with a supervisor, and her response was I am sorry and the conversation is over.\", 'united airlines United Airlines business class is the worst business class I have flown. They are far and away the worst US airline. Flight attendants are mostly awful. Planes are old and poorly equipped. Seats could not be smaller. Packed tight in business class. Their business class is barely above coach seating in a modern airline.', \"united airlines Boarding the plane was no problem. An old United Airlines Boeing 747 but clean and in good condition. Was sitting beside the galley which was very noisy for most of the flight. Food was standard, I had a vegetarian pasta dish for lunch. It was ok, but small. Pre-landing snack was a turkey sandwich which was passable. I was surprised to see snacks being sold during the flight between meals. Other airlines would give out snacks for free on an 11 hour flight. Most of the flight crew were unfriendly and there was little communication from pilots or crew. The biggest disappointment was the entertainment. United Airlines do not have seat back entertainment on their 747's in economy. Instead there were just a few screens around the cabin. The screens were too far away from most seats, especially if you were sitting nearer the windows. Very disappointing that in 2015, a major airline would still operate like this on a long-haul flight. Fortunately I had laptop with me to access entertainment from United Airlines website, but on a number of occasions, internet access cut out stopping the films. Overall, a disappointing experience. In future, I will try and stay away from American carriers on transatlantic routes as European airlines offer much better service.\", 'united airlines Same aircraft all the way even though we changed in SFO. Fairly new Boeing 737/900 so was in very good condition. Late leaving LAS due to a computer fault on the aircraft so time in SFO for connection short. Very short first leg so only snack offered which was adequate. Made connection to Hawaii as did our bags so that was good flight from SFO to KOA uneventful food OK as was IFE arrived slightly early. No moans.', 'united airlines Flight departed early KOA and arrived early in SFO but advantage lost as our gate was occupied so spent ages on the taxiway. Flight was good, crew friendly enough, food was the worst of this trip. A cheese burger that looked and tasted as if it had been in the oven for days. Everything else was ok.', 'united airlines Aircraft was a little old and tired but everything worked. Crew friendly enough food average. Aircraft departed and arrived on time along with the bags. Extra room in first class appreciated so no moans.', 'united airlines The flight was delayed progressively from 45 minutes to 2 hours, which meant that all passengers with shorter connections than 2 hours would miss our connecting flights. The staff at the gate would not do anything to help several passengers get re-routed and had no problem saying other flights were \"oversold\", as was this flight to begin with. The gate staff was basically put on the spot when other passengers and I had already looked into our options online and they would have no choice but to at least check for availability. In short: terrible customer service at the gates. Eventually I was re-routed to Denver after discovering that both the Chicago and the Houston flights (second option) were oversold. The plane to Denver was old and not well kept. On top of that, one of the gate employees wanted to check all of the wheeled carry-on luggage of boarding group 4, even when she was told many of us had short connections. I was not going to risk having my carry-on stayed in Denver at this point. In addition, when we arrived in Denver the flight that was departing from the nearby gate to Eugene, OR was canceled for crew reasons. United Airlines need to solve their staff, crew and airplane issues. By the way, none of the flight delays could be explained by bad weather.', \"united airlines We arrive at STL airport to find that we are a minute late to be able to check our baggage. They then schedule us on the next flight which means we now have a layover and will be getting to our destination two hours late. After waiting for our new flight to board we are notified that our flight is late and we will have to take a different flight now which will make us now another hour late on top of the other two hour delay. To top it all off they didn't have two seats available together and not once did a staff member apologize.\", \"united airlines United timeliness and organization was sub par both going to and coming back from Chicago. Delayed 1.5 hours on departing flight, with no text messages or updates from United. Return flight boarded relatively on time, though very disorganized with sorting out room for people's carry-owns, only to sit in a cloud of jet fumes for 45 min on the runway. Captain took half an hour just to come on and explain the hold up. Leg room in coach is even less than other airlines. I recommend flying elsewhere.\", \"united airlines We booked tickets through Lufthansa and were reassured that we would get everything we had ordered. When my children and I got to the plane we weren't given the seats we had ordered. In fact the agent tried to blame me for not telling her about my request. When I said that we were told on the phone that everything was reserved she snapped it's reserved but not guaranteed. I did get the seats though. Our ordered children's meal never arrived since they discontinued it according to the flight attendant who spoke with me. the other flight attendant told a different story to the other families. I asked for the cot and was told that my daughter was too long. I will conclude by saying it was on of the worst flying experiences.\", 'united airlines Rather old aircraft, however, business class is modern and fully-flat seats are comfortable. Inflight entertainment is ok, however a bit limited when it comes to music content. Appereance of some crew members was poor. Furthermore, attentiveness was not of its best, eg. no water was supplied after the main service. Food and beverages, I have had worse but also better food in business class. Wines were nothing to complain about, although crew were not very attentive when it came to refills. Cabin floor was not very clean on boarding the aircraft. Airport Lounge (Los Angeles) Delta Airport Lounge Terminal 7 with limited space, limited selection of food and alcoholic beverages, eg. needs to be paid extra. One of the worst lounges I have seen so far.', 'united airlines United Airlines Business class seats are comfortable for a 3 hours flight, although they are not fully-flat. Use of inflight entertainment system needs to be paid extra, which is highly disappointing in business class. Service of crew in business class was very slow, inefficient and not attentive. Instead of serving the customers cabin crew were having a good time while talking in the kitchen. Food and beverages, apart from that they run out the food I wanted to order, the food itself was poor and not fresh. Airplane was not clean. Airport service in Houston, since the plane arrived with a major delay I missed my connection flight (Delta flight as well). I was advised to consult the ground staff to organise my onward journey. The lady at the ground desk was unfriendly, very demotivated and slow. This was the frist and the last time flying with United Airlines.', 'united airlines I upgraded online in Costa Rica prior to the flight to four premium economy seats for my family, which were in an exit row. Upon boarding, we were informed that since my grandson was only 6 years old, he could not sit in the exit row. This information did not appear anywhere on the United Airlines website. He and his mother were changed to two premium seats in the front bulkhead and we were had to keep our two premium seats in the exit row over the engine, and with no window shades. The noise was unberable, and flying into the early morning sun with no window shade was blinding. The FA dealt with this situation by inserting a flight safety procedures card into the window frame and then a folded newspaper which kept falling out. No explanation or apology for the missing window shade was ever given. We asked twice to change seats, as ultimately did the couple sitting in the other two premium seats in the exit row. We finally received two premium seats but in separate parts of the cabin. When I asked the FA for a can of ginger ale, she responded that she would first have to serve the other pasengers and would give me the can only if she had any left over. Finally she brought me an opened can with a flat beverage. No other beverage service was offered, nor any food for purchase on the 3.5 hour flight. The disembarking in Toronto was at an off-gate location: we descended down a very steep stairs onto the unsheltered tarmac until our suitcases were unloaded, and were then required to walk on the tarnac for 20 minutes to the Customs area. This is not the first time that I have had a totally unacceptable experience flying with United Airlines, the last being in their Global First Class cabin to South America. United Airlines seems to be firmly in the lead in the race to the bottom, and is apparently determined to keep this unenviable position. Disgraceful, again!', 'united airlines First flight of our trip was delayed. Attendants said maintenance issues were reported the night before but not addressed. Mechanic showed up late. 1.5 hour delay caused us to miss our connecting flight. En-route we were told connecting flight had also been delayed but that we should be able to make it. We were told they were expecting us. Me, my wife, and my two small children ran across the airport. When we arrived we were told that they had sold our seats to stand by. The plane was delayed an additional 2 hours. My connecting flight actually left 8 hours later. We missed an entire day in Costa Rica. For compensation I was offered a $7 meal voucher that didn\\'t work at the majority of facilities in Houston Airport. It did work at a fast food restaurant, but was not enough to cover even a basic meal. Certainly not \"the friendly skies\" as advertised and certainly not customer oriented.', 'united airlines Our scheduled flight to Baltimore was initially delayed, due to a reported air conditioning service issue, and then cancelled. As soon as the flight was cancelled on the gate placard, attendants at the gate indicated that they were unable to answer questions about alternatives because their shift was ending. They referred all of the passengers to a service area a few hundred yards away. The people at that service desk indicated that they were busy and would take hours to answer questions, and in turn referred us to another service desk that supposedly had no crowd. The second service desk was more crowded than the first but eventually got to us. They informed me that they could not get me to Baltimore that day but that they could get us to Washington and provide a shuttle to Baltimore, free of charge. We were then sent to a gate that had been double-booked. After United reassigned the gate (another cross-terminal jaunt), we learned the fight to Washington had been delayed. When we finally did arrive at Washington, the United attendants there indicated we were on our own to Baltimore. This lack of dependability, customer service, and honoring promises-based on my experience-has become a hallmark of United over the last two years. I will not fly United again, regardless of rates or schedule.', 'united airlines We flew from Santiago to Houston and had a connection to Louisville. We arrived early in the morning in Houston and one hour later our connection flight to Louisville was cancelled. They offered no explanation and said that the best they could do was to send us to Cincinnati and from there we had to drive (2 hours) to Louisville. No apologies, no offer to pay for the car rental. No customer care. They said that was the only option and if I did not like it there was nothing they could do. They said all other flights were booked.', 'united airlines The flight from Fort Myers to Pittsburgh was okay, though the first aircraft to Newark was the most cramped seating I have experienced. I am 5 ft tall but it was impossible to move at all. My knees were jammed against the seat in front of me. My flight from Pittsburgh to Newark coming home on August 2nd was cancelled due to no crew being available. United rebooked me on a 5.30 am flight the next morning. I needed to be back Sunday night, so I called United to rebook. After waiting 40 minutes, I finally spoke to an agent and I was rebooked on Delta. Since I had already checked in to the original United Flight and paid a $25 baggage fee, I asked if I would have to pay an additional $25 to Delta. The answer was \"yes\" but in theory I could easily get a refund online. I spent 1.5 hrs on the phone with United attempting to do this. As I write this I am still on hold.', \"united airlines Have been travelling from Ireland on a round the world ticket for last 6 weeks. By far the worst airline we have used. Service on this flight very mediocre. Senior flight attendant sour and unwelcoming. Bright and bubbly with her colleagues - not so much with the passengers. Only flight that did not have complimentary food and the available snacks to purchase were poor. This flight was 7.10 am so many hadn't eaten. Next flight to San Francisco slightly better, the air hostess was much friendlier. Inflight entertainment? What was that? Had to purchase earphones - entertainment woeful. Would avoid this airline in the future\", 'united airlines Every time I fly United something happens to derail my trip or make my trip miserable. This trip we missed our connecting flight because we sat on the tarmack in Boston for an hour because they were having delays in loading luggage. We missed our connecting flight by 10 minutes and are now stuck overnight in Denver. So let me see, they could have waited 5-10 minutes for us to make our scheduled flight, or not wait and pay hotel and food for two people. What kind of business sense is that? This was my last straw with United - I will avoid this airline at all costs.', \"united airlines My experience took a full 2 days when it should have taken only 15 hours. My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti, we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food, nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals. Then once the luggage came we had to wait for at least an hour to go through the last inspection and then we we were home free.\", 'united airlines Everytime I fly with this airline there is a 3 or more hour delay due to \"awaiting aircraft.\" One time is was because the pilot was in a different city and had to get to Boston to fly out, which took 5 hours! Another time the plane was awaiting the crew which was coming from a different city apparently. Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous. First off I had a connection flight and was not notified of the delay. Secondly, they had no one at the desk to assist customers trying to find a new flight and when I finally found someone at a different gate, who was semi helpful, she informed me that the next flight out would be 15 mins before my new scheduled departure time. So in my experience this airline is all about delays if your current flight is coming from another city. I get it, things happen but this airline really needs to improve its punctuality. I only took this flight this time beacuse of my miles and I was disappointed again.', 'united airlines I found all the staff I interacted with friendly and professional, the aircraft was clean, the food was fine but not enough. The seats were a nice size. I had never flown with United before and was pleasantly surprised. Although I was sat next to morbidly overweight people on both my flights the seats were big enough that the people next to me did not squeeze onto my seat like they usually do on Virgin flights which I liked. I was late getting to the gate (very much my fault) and the initial employee I spoke to was rude and short with me and refused to even see if I could make it to the flight even though my baggage was still on board and the food was not yet delivered to the plane, she told me \"no, you aren\\'t getting on the flight\" and refused to even see if it was a possibility. Thank goodness for the other lady who phoned someone, told me I was fine to get on the plane because they were waiting for the food and my luggage was still aboard, and sent me through. I slept most of the flight to the UK. The touch screen with my seat on the way back to the USA was really finicky which was a bit annoying, I liked the selection of movies and that they played as soon as I was sat in my seat rather than waiting till after take off for them to work. I bought duty free stuff inflight and the staff that helped me were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airline and will use it again.', \"united airlines Delays were not announced to passengers in a timely manner and lack of assistance in order to accommodate or aide in booking other flights for customers to either reach their connecting flights or to their destinations was displeasing. The way the United Airlines handled my partner's luggage that was left behind at our originating destination was a stressful start to our trip. Upon arriving at the airport around 5.45pm to catch our 8.20pm flight, flight 5237, from Sacramento to Los Angeles, on Monday July 20 2015, we checked in promptly and breezed through security. We sat by the gate with a plane that sat there for as long as we had, little did we know this was our plane. By the time boarding came around, our flight was delayed for another hour, occurring multiple times for the next few hours. It was my hope that during the initial delay the service desk would help customers explore other options to reach connecting flights and/or destinations to avoid delays or issues upon arriving in Los Angeles. We were worried about missing our connecting flight the entire time. The second delay hits and people began to be frantic and changed flights. My party and I anxiously wondered if we were going to make our connecting flight or if we needed to rebook online. We called customer service a few times to inquire about alternative options but were never offered alternatives until hours later right before the last delay was lifted after 11am and needed to quickly decide on either taking the flight or flying out of another airport. I am baffled at the lack of customer service. My second and major complaint was the issue with our checked luggage getting left behind in Sacramento as we made our way to Cancun. We checked in before 6pm and sat at the terminal looking at the same airplane the entire time until we boarded it only to find out my luggage was never placed on the same plane.\", 'united airlines Round trip Newark to Rome on an updated Boeing 767. Coach seats very comfortable. IFE was good, on demand movies, tv. Meals were edible, which is all I have come to hope for. Flights on time and bags arrived with us. Only issue was the surly treatment from almost all the flight attendants. Don\\'t know why they hate their customers so much. I fly with United Airlines often, but they either need to lose the \"friendly skies\" tag line or, better yet, train their crew in the basics of good customer service.', \"united airlines I have travelled to the USA on many occasions mainly to visit family and go on shopping sprees. I mainly use United Airlines as I always found them to have competitive prices and good baggage allowances. However on my last few trips the free baggage allowance was reduced from two bags to one. Last week my bag was only 4 lbs overweight and I was charged the enormous amount of $200. I realise that there are reasons for charging for overweight bags, but there are plenty customers who are overweight and are not charged extra for seats and there was also lots of youngsters travelling with 2 large pieces of hand luggage struggling to carry bags along the aircraft walkway. I think it's wrong that an average size and weight customer gets charged a huge amount for a 4lb overweight bag.\", 'united airlines The brand of this airline is \"Friendly\". Well, I must say they are everything but friendly. Not a single smile in ground nor during the flight. No thank you, no complete sentences when they throw the food to the passengers like cattle. Rude, arrogant staff not speaking foreign languages. Any European airline, even the worst, is better than any American airline. At least nowadays.', 'united airlines We booked our family of four on a flight 7 months. After several flight number and times changes we just learned that our 8 and 7 year old have seats 10 rows away from us and each by themselves.

They \"upgraded\" their seats after merging with Continental which really means a downgrade. They crammed more seats on their airbus airplanes making legroom even more restricted. They removed all forms of entertainment from their fleet. I used to be able to listen to the radio in the armrests with my own headphones, but they removed them and I am incredibly bored, cannot get to sleep because of how uncomfortable the seats are now! They don\\'t use the television screens that fold down anymore, they have incredibly rude and unhelpful employees. United Airlines is expensive for the quality of service you get.', 'united airlines As a child our family always flew United. However, it has gotten progressively worse through the years to the point that I would rather pay a more for a ticket than fly United ever again. Our family of 5 (one of whom was a special needs daughter) was to fly from Buffalo to Chicago to San Francisco to Anchorage where we were to then start our Alaskan cruise. Upon arriving at Buffalo, the check in machine didn\\'t work right. The lady behind the counter was nice enough but said she could not help us with gate-to-gate connection (e.g. passenger carts) as that was something \"you didn\\'t do\" and simply didn\\'t seem to care that we had a need. In Chicago we sat on the tarmack for almost an hour before we took off, causing us to get in late in SF for our connecting flight to Anchorage. We ran to our gate as best we could with our special needs daughter, saw our plane sitting at the gate, but weren\\'t allowed to get on due to the gangway being pulled away from the plane already even though the United personnel told us, \"Oh, we knew you were coming. We just couldn\\'t wait for you.\" To make matters worse United booked us on a flight to Anchorage for the next night. In the end we got flights on Alaska Airlines and got into Anchorage about 2:30am which allowed us time to sleep in our booked hotel room before making the trip to Seward by bus, getting us there in plenty of time to board our ship. Alaska Airlines personnel were superb in demeanor, helpfulness, and care, something that United personnel were seriously lacking. Our return trip from Vancouver, BC to Buffalo started out much differently than when we went. The staff in Vancouver were helpful and courteous. But once we got to Chicago, they were anything but! I think the personnel of United Airlines in the US could take a few lessons from those from our Vancouver neighbors. We have had other unacceptable experiences in the past with United Airlines but this one takes the cake and is really the one that put us over the edge. No more United Airlines for this family!', 'united airlines Since there is only one flight a day to Aguadilla PR from Newark we have taken this flight a number of times, it is always late. In January, the delay was due to \"insufficient crew\" this time, the almost 1.5 hour delay was due to \"awaiting aircraft\". This flight had incredibly cramped seats that are hard and have almost no recline. The pocket in fron of the seat was very low on the seat in front so that when I put my book in the pocket it bulged out so much that I had to keep my knees apart. The entertainment is only for a $7.99 fee per person, and there was only one offer of a four ounce cup of a liquid for the entire 3.5 hour flight. United planes are new so this uncomfortable seat situation is going to continue, I would avoid United if at all possible. Fares are also higher than other carriers.', \"united airlines It's unfortunate nowadays that people only ever seem motivated to write if they have a 'bad experience'. I have flown with UA pretty regularly from Australia to East coast USA and have had no real issues. The 787 is a great plane, the crew on these flights are experienced and efficient and the food is generally on a par with competitive airlines.

The agent was very rude with my wife and refused to help and told her to talk to other passengers on the plane. We board the aircraft brand new to find that the seats were so close together that at 6 Feet tall my knees were in the seat in front of me and the entertainment system did not work. We board our second flight, I sit down and literally have the seat back cave in with an audible pop. The seats should have been replaced years ago by the time we got off the aircraft 5 hours later my wife and I could barley walk. Coming back and go to drop off the bags they had 6 lines going and one attendant, get our boarding passes and they had us divided up all over the aircraft, talked to the gate attendant his response we have been paging you and was very rude with us. I have a type one diabetic and a 3 yo that needs someone to ride with them, after fighting with them got it fixed meanwhile my other 2 children had to sit elsewhere on the plane and not with us.

My flight was scheduled for around midday. Fifteen minutes before the flight my Dad received an email saying the flight was delayed until 2.30. I was annoyed but ok about the 2 hour wait. Then he received another email saying that the flight had been delayed until 9.15, this is unnacceptable as this was a 9 hour wait and we had different things booked in Las Vegas for my family to attend. We had recieved no apology until my Father went to customer services and we recieved different seats on our plane which didn't even make a difference. This inconvenience wasted a day of our trip and I certainly do not recommend flying with United Airlines.\", 'united airlines On Sunday, June 14th, my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin, Ireland. Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United\\'s flights that night and following day were \"oversold\". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was \\'not allowed\\'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home. I will never fly United again.', 'united airlines On my e-confirmation it clearly states â€œmealâ€\\x9d.

They actually scanned our boarding passes in and had us lined up ready to get on the plane just to have us turn around and go back inside to later find out our flight would be cancelled. We then had to fly to Eugene instead, rent a car, and drive 2.5 hours to get to our destination (Bend). Then, I was told my bag would arrive at our place of stay the next morning. I did not receive my bag until 7pm on the 17th. Then, as if this wasn\\'t enough to deal with on our way there, my flights coming home were a disaster as well. We had to return our rental car to Redmond rather than Eugene as that\\'s where our flight was leaving on Sunday. Then, the flight from Redmond to Denver was \"overweight\" due to temperatures in the area. We had to wait until 5 people volunteered to change flights before our flight could leave. I get to Denver only to find out my flight from Denver to SLC was delayed. Not to mention, I already had a 3 hour layover and this delay made it 4+ hours. The flight continued to get delayed and didn\\'t end up leaving Denver until about 1am. I did not get home until 3am. I am completely upset with my entire United experience and will not be flying United again. The customer service was awful. None of the employees even knew what was going on and when approached with a question they were unbelievably disrespectful.', 'united airlines Flight cancelled due to maintenance! United and American follow a breakdown maintenance policy which causes a lot of inconveniences to passengers. This is the fourth time in a few months that this happened to me with United as well as AA. I tried United and American as an alternative for Delta but they cannot compete.', 'united airlines Never have I seen such laziness and attitude from a flight crew. We were supposed to fly from Newark to St. John\\'s, but we had to turn around due to \"weather\". I then checked the weather, it was mainly cloudy. No weather whatsoever. Then, when we landed in Newark, we had to wait in line for an hour, then we finally got seats on a plane the next morning, and we stayed at the Marriott Newark. The next morning, our flight was pushed 7 times. Yes, 7 times, because the runway was \"wet\" until it finally got cancelled. I had to wait in line for 3 hours until someone booked me another flight connecting with Air Canada, which is an excellent airline. Never have I had any problems with Air Canada. This is the first and last time I will be flying with United Airlines.', \"united airlines First of all there is absolutely no leg room on United airplanes. I'm not a very tall fellow standing only 5 feet and 10 inches tall and I still had hardly any leg room. Plus, I'd rather sit in a metal folding chair instead of the seats that United has. About halfway through the flight the attendant starting offering drinks. She offered a drink to both the other people in my row and then looked me in the eye and kept on going without offering me a drink. I had asked her in a loud enough voice so she could hear me as to why she didn't offer me a drink and all she told me was I needed to keep my voice down. Then she kept on walking.\", 'united airlines Nice stewardesses but terrible flight, very uncomfortable seats and cramped airplane. Plus, they charged me an extra $100 for excess baggage while I had only 2 bags and was traveling overseas. They told me well you can have 2 bags for overseas but you are traveling in the US right now so you have to pay and mind you all their flights are going to be within US first before going to Europe where I was going however no where I was told about this. So in effect, they charge you $100 more for the ticket without telling you up front. Oh wait, yes they tell you in a fine print somewhere in the 3 page document. However, I have traveled with many other airlines and none did that to me.', \"united airlines I paid an extra $52 to upgrade my seat. The staff were not overally friendly. The two ladies that were in charge of first class were needless to say unpleasant and just had an attitude about them is the nicer way of saying it. I went to the washroom in first class because the line up was very long at the back of the plane, and since I was sitting right behind first class and no one was using the washroom at the time I decided to go use it. As soon as I walked up to use the washroom I got dirty glares from both female flight attendants, one which said you cannot use this washroom and I kindly explained how the line was extremely long at the back of the plane. She proceeded to let me use the washroom after rolling her eyes at me. I have never had a good flight ok United or Air Canada. They are rude and disrespectful and I'm not the first one to say that.\", 'united airlines This flight was originally scheduled to leave Tulsa on the 10th and return on the 17th. With no explanation of any kind the flight was cancelled. I was forced to rebook both flight and hotel based on leaving on the 8th. On the 8th the plane was 2.5 hours late leaving Tulsa and part of that time was spent sitting on tarmac. We missed connection in Denver. We were then placed on standby for a flight scheduled to arrive in Denver at approximately 3.00 pm. That flight was delayed over 3 hours! We discovered it had been oversold so the odds of making that flight were nil. We were forced to rent a car and drive 5 hours to Gunnision. The return trip was worse, if thats possible. The flight was scheduled to leave at noon. The first announcement was that flight was delayed. Then flight was cancelled - allegedly on the basis of mechanical problems. We were able to determine that the plane in question was still flying and headed for its next destination-leaving Gunnison passengers stranded.

Cost us additional parking, 1 full day of eating in airports, and a full day not spent with Family as planned. I will never again fly United if it is up to me.', 'united airlines You just spent $1800 on a Economy R/T flight to Spain. The initial snack was a small piece of cheese and two crackers. The meal hours later was bland tasteless turkey loaf, canned over cooked green beans, puree sweet potato, brick mango sorbet. Remember you paid $1800 dollars for this. 2 hours out of SFO on the return flight breakfast was served. A small sandwich arrives. It is extremely cold, practically frozen. One small slice of cheese and ham. Interestingly the outer wrapping states: warmable! Remember, this is a $1800 flight. Few fellow passengers are thrilled with this breakfast treat. What is wrong with this picture? Would you fly United if this happened to you?', 'united airlines First flight from Tampa to Houston was delayed by only a few minutes. But by the time we got off the plane to run down to our connecting flight, we were alerted (via the schedule boards, not staff) that our flight to Portland suddenly had a 4.5 hour delay. It was 8.30 by this time, so by the time the plane had arrived (late) and let its current passengers disembark (which was not guided), they made an announcement that there was no flight crew for the plane and that the flight had been cancelled. What kind of company works this way? A completely full flight, not only shows up hours behind schedule, but all of the sudden has no crew? Complete blasphemy. Rude attendants. And not to mention lack of organizational skills. Never planning on flying this airline ever again, even though I signed up for their loosely promised rewards system. Not to mention the maze of an airport we got lost in just trying to find a taxi! Absolutely terrible.', \"united airlines A very enjoyable flight in Business Class from YVR to SFO. We had priority check in, which was great as the economy queues were really long, thus we were given much more time to spend in YVR airport. However, I was a bit disappointed that Business Class passengers didn't have a priority security check lane in YVR. The seats were wide and legroom was great for a 2.5 hour flight. We were served a pre-takeoff drink and then a two course meal, which consisted of mushroom soup and a beef salad/egg chicken sandwich. The cabin crew were friendly and I couldn't really ask for more on this flight. We had Personal TV's on the flight and a wide range of newly-released movies. Wifi was available but I did not use it. We had 4 checked bags and they were one of the first to come out due to priority baggage, and helped us make use of our limited amount of time in San Francisco. I will definitely fly this route again on Business Class with United.\", \"united airlines This is probably the worst airline I've flown. No entertainment, only a drink and peanuts and the worst service I have seen. The seats had little legroom and were very uncomfortable.

My 6 year old son is laying on his father because there is nowhere to get a proper rest. I understand the weather has been bad in Denver but we were in the customer service line for 2.5 hours after we missed our connecting flight due to the flight being diverted to Cheyenne Wyoming due to need of fuel and to get back to Denver airport took additional 2 hours. Everything was shut down by the time we were done with customer service and all hotels were fully booked, mind you its 12.00 midnight, how to get transportation to any hotels - no such arrangements were done by the airline. I did not mind paying for hotel out of my pocket but at least give proper directions or some guidance to help the people who were diverted not only due to weather but also due to low fuel. The hostess was so rude when my son asked for some water and was sent to his seat and told that they would be serving in few minutes. My 6 year old had been asking for water since we sat down on the plane, and only asked over 50 minutes. Total disregard for a little child.', \"united airlines Stuck at Chicago airport waiting, and waiting, for my flight to Toronto. I will be bypassing United's cheap two or three-leg fares in future. In fact, I will be bypassing United altogether. Totally unreliable. Each of my three flights in the past 12 hours has been delayed extensively.\", \"united airlines The ticket was quite cheap. But the price you pay for that is a three-leg journey. Reading United reviews I was worried about on-time departures and making connections. Sure enough.

There is no such thing as a cheap ticket.\", \"united airlines On our connecting flight they had to change the plane and 46 people lost their seats. The lucky ones who did not lose their seats ended up having a seat change. They boarded over 30 minutes late. My husband and I were separated because they allowed other passengers to take our seats. When trying to get seats near each other the stewardess didn't even attempt to fix the problem and basically told us that we could take a mother away from her kids to sit next to each other. Poor customer service, terrible timeliness, and complete lack of communication and urgency. If I could give this airline a zero rating, I would.\", 'united airlines UA is raking in the profits but that was certainly not noticeable on this old A320 service from New York to Denver. The plane is old. The First Class seats are tired. Service is exhausting. On this flight they had 1 flight attendant for 12 pax! The problem that I have with UA is that they are so inconsistent with their product and service range. On a positive note - I do have to say that my meal was quite good.', \"united airlines When I was leaving from Denver to Houston it was during the national glitch. I couldn't check my bag because I was one minute past the time of being able to check my bag, they had to switch my flight to a later time. Then it was delayed. My gate had been changed. I walked to the new gate. The staff at the gate told me it was back at the other one, so I walked back and forth trying to figure out which gate I was at.

Our little one got sick on the flight and there were no bags, it looked like the plane had not even been properly cleaned before our delayed flight. I would also think that after having people waiting such a long period of time that they would offer something other than a beverage on the plane, they didn't even seem to have coffee for the travelers when the flight finally left. A very disappointing and stressful travel day.\", \"united airlines I flew on 6/13/15 from Kansas City to Detroit. Due to the bad weather the flight that was supposed to leave KC at 6.10pm didn't board until close to 7.30pm.

When I boarded there was at least 5 lockers that were empty, more than enough space to fit my tiny carry-on bag. After we boarded the captain announced that we would have to wait another 30/40 mins. When we reached Chicago Airport they couldn't give us a gate so we waited in the aircraft for another 30/45 mins. I got a message on my phone that my connecting flight had already departed and re- booked me on a 2.15 pm flight the next day. When I finally got to talk to a customer representative I told her my situation and that I had to get to Detroit, she was kind enough to book me on an American Airlines flight. By the time I got done doing all these things it was almost 1am, almost all stores/restaurant were closed.\", \"united airlines We booked United as the price was by far the cheapest. I was really worried due to negative reviews. In the last fortnight we have taken 4 United flights and the only fault was that one had faulty TVs for all the party - but we always go well prepared so no real issue. All staff were very friendly even remembering your choice of drink which is quite something on a flight with hundreds. Entertainment system fabulous. Food typical airline stuff. No delays. We only had a 45 min gap between 2 flights but still had plenty time. Don't understand the negative reviews.\", 'united airlines The initial flight Montreal-Chicago-Denver was re-routed through Washington because of weather in Chicago on the way to Denver.

The lack of respect for individuals, their time, agenda, obligations, etc, is frankly annoying.', 'united airlines Just the worst company we have been flying with during our world tour. This is the only time in 10 years that we have seen such overbooking. You have to pay for everything, the seats canot be booked and couples are split up. Staff seem lazy and unpleasant.

I was traveling with my five-month-old infant and had her strapped to my chest. I asked if I could get someone to help me with my bag she said that I should check it. I said I just needed assistance putting it in the overhead bin. No help. When I boarded I ask the flight attendant to please help me, she just looked at me and asked why is your bag heavy? I said no I have a baby strapped to my chest. She just kept staring at me and finally a male passenger helped me.', 'united airlines I had an awful experience today. I showed up two hours before my flight to check in and check my bags. While we were checking in the system went offline. We were unable to print out our bag tags, along with maybe over 50+people. I tried to ask attendants for help, and they kept sending me to other people. Clearly a lack of training on their part. When I asked a blue shirt baggage attendant, she said it was most likely because I didn\\'t have funds. Very uncalled for. 50+ people felt the same way. As the lines became longer they started to manually check in bags at \"Additional Services\". The staff were very engaging with only themselves. United waved their baggage fee, because all of our flights were delayed due this unfortunate event. Apparently this also happened 6 weeks ago. When we arrived to Punta Cana, our bags never arrived. When I contacted customer service, they said they had no idea where our bags were. Will not be using their services again.', \"united airlines Never in my life have I had so many delays. Also, their system has some sort of glitch today so apparently that means that had to cancel a ton of flights and delay many others.

I was quickly placed on stand-by for another flight to Chicago, but soon realized I would not be able to get on that flight, as others were trying to fly stand-by as well. I had to take my original flight, which was delayed three hours, due to the fact that the aircraft was coming from Dallas and was delayed due to storms. I missed my original flight to Appleton, so was booked on a later one. In all, I spent about 15 hours on planes and in airports. It was a long day, but except for one customer service representative at Newark, who acted as if I was an inconvenience, every other United employee I dealt with was kind and helpful.', 'united airlines This entire trip has been a fiasco. My first flight was 4 hours late, and my second flight 3 hours late. Communication to the travelers was either inaccurate or non existent. The Newark gate representative was yelling at another customer when I approached the kiosk, and was belligerent. I think that UA could have taken more care to have a plane, or crew, or whatever available as promised. I paid my fare on time.', 'united airlines Flight at 5.21pm was cancelled due to scheduled maintenance, which I understand. What I don\\'t understand is why there wouldn\\'t be another aircraft in use if they knew there was a flight scheduled. Then departure was scheduled for another flight 3 hours later at 9.00pm. Three hours later arrived, but still no sign of an aircraft. Now, the reason for an additional 2 hour and 5 minute delay was \"a late inbound aircraft coming from OH\". They can\\'t figure out what is going on, maintenance or a late inbound aircraft? The original departure at 5:21pm turned into a departure of 11.00pm.

The arrival snack was rather disappointing, a piece of bread with tomato sauce and some fruit. Thirty minutes before landing, the pilot finally came on and said, the fasten seatbelt sign is on and prepare for landing.', \"united airlines I have a huge problem with United overbooking flights. We arrived at the Durango airport 1 hour before our flight and were told the flight was overbooked and we could not board. There were available seats, but they were upgrades so we would have to pay the additional cost. That doesn't make sense to me. United sells more economy tickets than there are economy seats on the plane and then expects me to either pay more money to fly or spend the night, at my expense, in Durango. They should have just given us the seats. My son was on a flight leaving Durango after ours for Denver and because of delays missed his connecting flight for Oklahoma. After waiting in a line where passengers were receiving hotel vouchers, he was told in a very matter of fact tone that he did not qualify for a voucher. He eventually got his voucher but he did not need to go through what he went through to get it.\", 'united airlines I have recently flown to Guadalajara (Mexico) with United from Tokyo. NRT-IAH was on a Boeing 777 The seat has nothing to do with any modern airliner seat.

There is the latest in-flight entertainment system which comes actually with a very small screen. It hung 3 times while watching movies. One more time, it is relatively new but not comparable with modern systems. The service on board (if it can be called service) was the worst service I have had in the last 10 years. The crew were not polite, and didn\\'t ask once anything like \"Can I offer you something to drink?\" instead they look at you without saying anything, until you say what you want. If you are not fast enough they are gone. IAH-GDL was on Embraer RJ145 I wonder how they can operate this route with such small airplane when GDL airport is able to handle bigger airplanes. You can\\'t even stand up on this plane. Overall, my review is totally negative. It is like going back 30 years.

The aircraft was delayed by 3 hours in Newark because of \"the inbound aircraft not being available\" and when the aircraft finally did arrive, it developed a \"computer fault\" that further delayed departure by another hour.

The boarding is similar to Southwest as you line up in group numbers. The problem is that we paid for an economy plus seat and still had to wait at the end to board. The flight crew was average but what upset me was that a poor woman with limited English asked the flight attendant for some water so she could take medication before take off. She was pointing at what she needed in the galley and the flight attendant screamed at her and threatened her with disembarkation. For a five hour Pacific crossing all we got was one drink service and food purchase which is unacceptable. After a four hour stopover we boarded again with the same procedure. Once we got on our way the flight attendants provided their usual sub standard service. However, as this was a single aisle aircraft some passengers needed to go the bathroom and with drink service going on the access to the bathroom was restricted. The flight attendants in first class made sure that the economy passengers stayed in their section. All I can say is that flying domestically is more or less not worth it. Luckily, majority of my trip including two flights on Air New Zealand who treated their passengers with respect and were not afraid to offer complimentary food and drinks. It is sad that Continental Airlines got eaten up by United. As long as I can remember the service on United has been average and the nickname untidy is well earned.', 'united airlines On both flights from Australia to San Francisco and Los Angles to Sydney I wish to state the overall lack of enthusiasm forthcoming from flight attendants.

The lady helping me, who was trying very hard to try and lower the price, ended up knocking it down to about $300 US. Part of this issue was that they charged me for oversize and overweight for my ski bag. Most airlines charge a base $100 and the weight doesn\\'t matter unless it\\'s over the 70lbs max weight.

The cabin service was rather low - not poor but not good either. The good part was that the air in the Boeing 787 seems to be a little more moist and the pressure was like being at a lower altitude. They said that internet service was available but all you could connect to was united.com so I gave that a fail mark.', 'united airlines UA did get me safely from Vancouver to Quito and back again, but that was about the best I can say about the experience. I found rudeness characterizes how UA treats its customers. For example, it was clearly printed on my e-ticket that prepared meals would be provided, but what they do not say is that you first have to ask about the meal (flight staff never mentioned that food was even available), and then you are told to look at the menu if you want to purchase any food. The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US. As for entertainment, I am sure that you could have a great selection, but they charge you for watching everything and anything, including TV programmes. Inflight staff were rude beyond belief. Aside from behaving as though they were doing you a favour by even noticing that you were on the flight, several of the staff would openly talk about and complain about passengers within hearing distance of the passengers themselves. I have flown on some of the European discount airlines such as EasyJet, but I would gladly take 4 EasyJet flights to get to a destination than ever fly with United.', 'united airlines I left for Detroit on a SIN-HKG-ORD-DTW flight on 7 June 2015. The two legs to HKG and ORD were fine, in fact, I arrived a hour ahead of schedule in ORD, giving me a comfortable 3 hours transit. The incoming aircraft for my connection ORD-DTW came in a hour late, and by then we were caught in the storm and flights were grounded. We boarded the aircraft twice, and were told to deplane. Eventually the flight was cancelled. A 3:50pm flight to get me from ORD to DTW, I was still in ORD at 930pm. I can\\'t get my checked bag as there is no procedure for that, and it will be on the next flight out to my final destination. We were given discounted hotel coupons, and I was rebooked on a 4:07pm flight the following day. As it was only 4 hours by bus from Chicago to Detroit, I decided to take mega-bus rather than to fly, and thank goodness I did that, because the rebooked flight on the next day was again cancelled due to air control issues! My bag actually arrived at Detroit earlier than I did, and I had to make a trip to the Detroit airport to get it. My woes didn\\'t end. 10 days later, I was going to get back to Singapore from Reagan (DCA-ORD-HKG-SIN). At Reagan, I couldn\\'t check-in, because my entire itinerary was cancelled. I didn\\'t get a reason for the cancellation, and got rebooked on the same itinerary. Alright never mind that I have middle seat for all 20 hours flight. At ORD, I tried to see if there are other seats available at the gate, and the staff was very rude, and unhelpful. \"There are only middle seats available, what do you expect me to do?\". She did not even try to look at my tickets. If she had, she would have seen that I got rebooked on economy plus, and telling me that would have made me feel better about the 15 hours flight. Onboard the plane, I was lucky, and only the aisle seat on the row behind me was occupied, and I was able to have a restful flight on a window seat. Why was the staff at the gate not willing to even look at my ticket? She didn\\'t even look at her screen to check.', \"united airlines This was very much a bare boned flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. At the last minute, as part of the closing doors announcement, the flight attendant announced that entertainment was only available through the United app, which she stated should be downloaded while we were on the ground. I'm fairly certain there was a charge for the entertainment, plus a charge for the necessary wifi connection. The premium economy was okay. It did have extra legroom and more recline (my big issue) than regular economy seats, but the width was barely adequate. And the aisles seem to have gotten narrower since I last flew on a plane. The only food available was for sale. It felt like the old time trains with someone hawking food and drinks throughout the trip.\", \"united airlines The boarding was ordered. The airplane was shabby with extensive signs of wear and tear. The seat was dirty and sticky, but relatively comfortable. No PTV. Asked for the advertised sparkling wine but was told they don't have it and instead was given cheap white wine in minuscule plastic glass. Twenty minutes after boarding we were told that there is mechanical problem with the aircraft and were told to go to customer service. Since it was almost midnight, there was only 1 customer service representative for almost 300 passengers. Called their call center and was given last seat on the last flight departing LAX this night. It was economy middle seat in the rear part of the aircraft. Missed my connection to CMH in ORD. Customers service in ORD is awful. Representatives are not competent and are arrogant. Was told by one representative that no flight to CMH available today. When insisted (I am a Gold Premier) they found me seat on American flight but told me that I need to pay 374$ for this 50 min flight. I refused, and asked them to put me on the next available flight which was departing 12 h later. They refused to give me a hotel voucher or meal voucher. I went to customer service in the terminal 3 and they gave seat on flight that was scheduled to depart 8 h later but put me on the waiting list. I waited 4 hours at the gate and finally there was a seat on one of the flights. I wonder how this company is continuing their business with such an awful customers service, unreliable aircrafts and such a bad treatment of their loyal customers.\", \"united airlines An old plane with a very poor entertainment screen. The system had to be rebooted several times and then the film didn't run smoothly. If this were a budget airline, then they'd be doing fine, but it's not. Cabin staff were sometimes friendly but overall I had the impression that they were just doing their job. I just thought they weren't really that professional compared to other airlines. United Airlines have some catching up to do if they can.\", \"united airlines Domestic First Class/International Business Class, ORD-EWR-MXP. Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical â€˜old Unitedâ€™ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served â€“ no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger. Much of the US hub counter staff is now outsourced and they are of little help when something goes wrong. The hard product and service is average to slightly below average. Economy Plus on UA is still great value but I am starting to avoid United when flying on an expensive ticket or an itinerary requiring connections.\", 'united airlines Previously we flew United to the US in August 2015 - Sydney to SFO, SFO to LAX, then LVG to Sydney via SFO. No problems, no delays, no cancellations. This past May we flew again to the US with United. I have to admit that this time I was concerned as I had read many bad reviews about the airline. We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX. However that said the pilot was able to make up time in the air and we actually landed early in LAX and easily made our connecting flight to New York. This was the only problem we encountered with United on this trip.', 'united airlines Terrible plane for that long a flight, Too small - Too noisy! Boeing 737-900 Like most U.S. carriers = the flight attendants are average at best! They spend most of their time socializing with each other and not providing service to passengers. Flying today is just a glorified bus! Passengers are partially to blame, but the airlines are mainly to blame - Baggage fees, paying for meals and drinks, paying for more leg room \"economy plus\". Planes are dirty! Also, United has changed its Frequent Flyer Program and is no longer #1 in my opinion! Loyalty is no longer rewarded. It is all how much you spend for a flight!', 'united airlines I flew from Sacramento to San Antonio through Denver for my sisters funeral. Not the best time to be delayed by a full hour and have to rush to the next flight just to make it before doors were closed. They excused themselves saying it was the weather. But here it is 3 weeks later flying home and not only was my first flight delayed but so was my second flight. There was no room for all the luggage and people had to put 5hem under the plane. While I am delayed my spouse is driving 3 hours to wait an hour. I had to feed my children in the airport expensive cheap food. Never again will I fly United. They need to quit booking flights till they can get their seating under control and their flights timed right. They need to get their act together big time..', 'united airlines We were due to fly from Orlando to Washington yesterday. The first flight was cancelled due to bad weather. We were offered a later flight which was late, but assured by United customer service personnel that the Manchester flight knew we were coming as we would make it. I ran from one flight to the other, arrived 10 mins before take off to be told we would not be allowed on the aircraft, which was standing on the tarmac. We then waited in line 2 hours 40 minutes at United customer services to be told all flights to Europe were full and we were booked on separated seats on the flight 24 hours later with no hotel, just 21 dollars of food vouchers. Never again!', \"united airlines On May 21, 2015, four passengers from my family traveled from Atlanta (USA) to Chennai (India) via EWR and ZRH by United Airlines. We each carried one small carry on bag. The airline refused to allow any of our carry on bag. We were carrying several prescribed medicines and one casual dress to use if there was any unexpected flight delay/cancellation. The airline reps were telling us that there is no space to put any carry on baggage. We begged them to allow at least 1 small carry on baggage instead of 4 carry on bags as we are international passengers and they refused it. They were so rude. They even threaten to call police, if we don't follow their instruction to check in the carry on bags. They were even forcing us to reschedule our international travel to with our carry on baggage. Finally, we did our international travel without any carry on baggage. We make international trips every year for the past 30+ years and United Airlines is the first airline that has forced us to do international travel without a carry on bag.\", \"united airlines Nickled and Dimed to death in First Class. I purchased First Class Tickets from Honolulu to Chicago via LA x2 persons for about $4000 in March 2015 there was no mention of $50 fee for Lounge privileges per person per visit . A meal was offered - Salmon salad. I asked for some more dressing (1 small container only was given for a large entrÃ©e salad) I was told they do not send extra dressing for an entree salad. It may seem like a small thing but it just indicates how cheap they have become. Employees good, policy's very bad. Every employee I came in contact was pleasant and helpful.\", 'united airlines I sat in the airport waiting for 13 hours because of a \"mechanical problem\" in the plane that I was suppose to take, and then after the tremendously long wait they cancelled the flight and sent everyone home or told them to sleep in the airport.

Made reservations and seating arrangements for 4 family members and when we got our boarding passes, all of us were scattered in other seats. They would not change them even though I had reserved them 2 months prior. The seats were tight, cramped. No WiFi unless you purchased it. No TV or movie on flight. Only free food items were coffee, tea, water, soda. You had to buy everything else if you wanted something to eat, even a cookie! I will never again use UA.', 'united airlines Took one of the first flights from Newcastle to New York Newark, was very disappointed on size of plane for long haul, one aisle for both trolley and visits to the loo as well as trying to stretch your legs on a 7.5 hours flight was nearly impossible, plus being near the toilets means being squashed with people leaning in to let people past them. Will continue to travel either from Edinburgh or Manchester with other airlines.', 'united airlines We have flown on United almost exclusively for the past few years, a half dozen times per year. This last trip was the last straw. On the way there, at DCA, there were two agents for about 150 people waiting to go on various flights. It took us a good 45 minutes to get through ticketing and baggage. We missed a connection because the crew was still in transit to the airport and we took off hours late. Of course our luggage did not make it. It arrived at our hotel 3 days later. Our flight home was cancelled a few weeks before, so we were forced to take one at 8am, which meant waking at 4.30 am. We arrived at the airport, boarded, and were taken off the plane as it did not pass inspection. The flight was then cancelled and the next one was at 8pm, arriving home at midnight. We went to the customer service desk with all 300 other passengers but decided to go to another customer service desk. The agent was nasty and sarcastic to those in front of us, and to us. We had to fly to a city 2 hours from home - giving up our first class seats- and rent a car to get home, uncompensated. But we are experienced, since the same thing happened a few months ago with United.', 'united airlines Our flight was scheduled for 14.23 from Houston to Mexico City. We started getting delay messages every 15 minutes till we were boarded at about 6.30 only to be told that we should wait in our seats for the airline to send pilots. I could not believe we were boarded when there were no pilots in the plane. Since the plane had obviously not been cleaned upon arrival from the previous flight we were instructed to leave the plane with all of our personal belongings and wait in the tunnel that leads from the terminal to the plane for a security inspection. After the cleaning was done we were instructed to board again to wait for a pilot to arrive. When the pilots did arrive they decided the plane needed refuelling so again we should wait a while for that to happen. The flight finally took off at around 8.00 at night. One of the flight attendants was doing his best to help lift the mood, another was authoritative and uninterested. I have learnt my lesson, no more United for me.', 'united airlines 5/6/15, DEN-GRR, A320, First Class, seat 1F.

Seat was very comfortable with plenty of width and legroom.

We will never fly with United again.\", \"united airlines We had no choice but to take United as it was a codeshare flight with ANA. This will be the first and last time we will take this terrible airline. To start with, no one even bothered to help us with the check-in process. When we called the nearest ground staff attention, it was like she doesn't want to do her job. On the bright side, she gave us a priority tag for our baggage. The problem didn't stop there. Even our in-flight experience was hell. The food was far from edible. It was my first time to encounter a long-haul flight where you have to purchase snacks for a minimum of $8.99. There were no individual screens for entertainment and the wifi wasn't working properly. Flight attendants were rude, yelling at passengers that they can't do this and that.\", \"united airlines My flight from Beijng to Washington was delayed three hours due to mechanical reason (captain told us it was due to the energy generator, the light won't turn on).

One of these flights was cancelled and United made no effort helping us to get another flight, so we had to book an additional flight on Southwest, causing us to lose a day of our vacation. Two of these flights had delays of 45 and 40 minutes sitting on the tarmac waiting to get off the planes. On one of these flights, the seating was cramped and the cabin was hot.

Changes to our departure times were text to our phones while we were already at the airport. Ground crew were dismissive of passengers who asked them any questions and were more interested in personal discussions than getting their job done. The cabin crew were very underwhelming and not accommodating passenger requests, to the point where you were not allowed a second cup of coffee because they had cleaned up and put everything away. The inflight entertainment cut out for our side of the plane and crew were not interested in doing anything about it. After 4 resetting attempts, the screens worked again. This being our second flight in 7 days we were expecting a little more enthusiasm and pride in their work from crew members. Being seated in economy class and not up the front meant that by the time our meals were served they had run out of popular items and we were left without a choice. No apology from crew, we were met with there's none left and this is what you can have. No attempt to salvage the situation at all and since this was a 14 hour flight, it was a long time without food. Of course, we were welcome to purchase an assortment of onboard snacks at very inflated prices. We will not be travelling with United again as this has not been a pleasant experience at all. We did not get cheap fares and felt that they need to make an effort to encourage passengers to fly with them again.\", \"united airlines I'm a performer and I flew from Australia to LA without a hitch on another airline and then all the domestic flights I needed to catch were with United. I got five different flights whilst I was in the states and every single one of them were below standard and just absolutely disgusting. 4 of those flights were cancelled.

Weather in the DC area delayed us 3 hours, the captain kept us informed and the crew distributed water and snacks. UA lived up to its promise - beer and wine were complimentary.

This was the second leg of a flight home from Europe. The plane is fairly new and it is one of the most uncomfortable planes that I have ever been on. And that includes the medium and smaller commuter jets. This was a six hour flight. I booked this flight seven months in advance paid extra for the economy plus seating and selected a bulkhead isle seat in row 8 which was behind the \"first class\" section of the plane. However between the \"first class\" section of this plane and my row is what can marginally be called a restroom. It was a six hour flight and this tiny bathroom with a sink barely big enough to wash your hands was in constant use. Each time the bathroom door was swung open and closed those of us in the adjoining rows were assaulted with bathroom smells. After a few hours in the air I noticed that the bathroom smells were more intense and that the floor next to the bathroom door was wet. I spoke to the purser who jumped up and immediately locked the bathroom door and took it out of service. That was a good temporary fix. However I would like to suggest to United that they consider removing that toilet unit from this plane configuration. It really ruins the flight for those stuck in seats close by. Also this plane has hard vinyl seats and headrests and no entertainment screens. The seats on Southwest are more comfortable.

I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges.

From the beginning there was a noticeable lack of service at the airport a very casual approach to almost being a big yawn.

We had paid for Economy Plus and a bulkhead all added extra's happy to pay when the service is provided in this case the seats were so narrow it was hideous the galley to our right was occupied most of time by a flight attendant who was more interested in himself than anything else the rest of the crew appeared very uninterested even the First Class crew could not smile.

We were showered in ice cubes from the galley twice I ordered a cocktail to help keep me calm $14 AUD for a drink such a rip off it was basically thrown at me. What has happened to United? We vowed never to fly with them again now here comes the kicker we had a return from LAX-HNL in late May a 777-200 lovely aircraft two roomy seats on the side in Economy Plus and some of the most charming flight crew I have met.

When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a \"water leak\". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn\\'t have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting. Finally the pilot came back over the speakers and informed us that the \"water leak\" was actually condensation from the coffee maker that the flight attendants failed to wipe up after the last use. Needless to say this made for some pretty incredulous passengers.', \"united airlines May 29 Beijing to Washington then Washington to New York and then Toronto. UA 808 UA 4001 AC727. United is by far the worst airline I have had the misfortune of being on. Of the two intercontinental flights I have taken with United all of them have involved a major delay (flight being cancelled or rescheduled to next day with a distress hotel room) or losing your luggage for days. United staff are also some of the rudest people I have had the misfortune of interacting with. The entire airline seems to take delight in punishing their customers for having the nerve to travel. Even though their airfares are low only take this airline if you enjoy spending your vacation time in airports or dealing with surly staff who seem to delight in making customers' lives hell.\", \"united airlines Flight to St Louis from Houston cancelled at night due to 'rain' so I had to get a room at my own expense as did hundreds of others finding a hotel took over an hour. Before leaving the Houston airport to my room I booked tickets to get me to St Louis the next day. Here is where United incompetence took over. Ticket was Houston to Tulsa Tulsa to St. Louis. When I got to Tulsa I ask why the flight from Tulsa to St Louis would take over 4 hours answer: you are going through Chicago but you won't have to leave the plane! Got to Chicago told that plane was not going to St. Louis went to desk asking where was my flight to St Louis flight and when answer: the St Louis flight just left I can put you on standby on the next flight! Got to gate and asked for standby update told here would be one standby seat available as one passenger was not going to make the departure time I was not to worry about getting on the standby position was mine. When it came time for stand by to board another person's name was called. Went back to the desk asking why I was not the standby person answer: she has more status! Then when names were announced who had seats but had not boarded my name was called. Went back to desk asking if I had a seat answer: oh is that you? Yes you have a seat! If I ever fly United again it will be out of desperation not by choice.\", \"united airlines Terrible service provided by the flight attendant. Unfortunately I had fallen asleep when the drinks were being served and when I asked the flight attendant for water she just kept on walking. I pushed the call button and as she was serving the water she sarcastically asked whether there was an emergency to which I responded that I felt almost dehydrated and her unbelievably rude answer was that I could have got up to get the water myself. It's bad enough that the airline doesn't serve any food at no charge anymore but to top it off their in-flight service has got much worse. I didn't pay $60 for this international flight it was much more!\", 'united airlines My wife and I took United for our honeymoon to Hawaii.

While they had my email address on file the only notification came through a text message. However this text didn\\'t inform us of anything but merely asked us to \"text yes\" to the text to receive subsequent messages. Assuming this was just another airline phishing attempt I ignored the message. While they knew I was not aware of the change no call attempt or email attempt was made. Overall I satisfied.', \"united airlines I arrived at the check-in counter 40+ minutes to departure. The attendant called the gate to see if the flight was delayed but they said it wasn't. I received this notification immediately after. United flight UA1246 on April 26 is delayed due to a late inbound aircraft arrival. Now departs: 2.00 pm). Hence I cannot check in my luggage. No worries I will throw all my liquids away and carry it on. Ultimately I gate checked one bag. Once the entire flight was boarded the pilot immediately stated we were going to be delayed and probably shouldn't have boarded the flight. We land 15-20 minutes late and we sit on the tarmac for another 10 minutes because our gate is taken. This is a common occurrence flying into IAH. The straw that broke the camel's back - zero communication and no empathy for every passenger that checked luggage. After everything else we had to wait about an hour to get our luggage. 4 planes on one belt and we were the 4th in line while only half of the belts were occupied.\", 'united airlines Our flight from Las Vegas to Charleston South Carolina took 28 hours. The first plane from Vegas to Houston was delayed because of mechanical problems. The connecting flight was delayed because of a pilot timing out.

The morning flight was changed because of a tire problem and again because of communications problems. We were offered 2500 points or $50 toward our next a United flight.', 'united airlines I had booked a trip to Hong Kong through Flight Network. on the way there (14 hour flight) the plane did not have any entertainment units or even a plug in for a laptop. On our way back we were to go from Hong Kong to San Francisco and then from San Francisco to Edmonton. United Airlines had switched the connecting flight to go through Chicago instead of San Francisco which I only found out when checking in on our departure day. The attendant at the United desk was unable to provide an explanation as to why the connection was switched and was basically of no help. This ended up amounting to a 9 hour delay and me missing a day at work.', 'united airlines Recently flew from West Palm Beach to Austin VIA Houston. The flight from Houston to Austin was on a brand new regional jet with nine first class seats. Unfortunately several sensors were showing and everyone needed to exit the plane. Within 30 minutes another new regional plane with the same configuration was waiting a few gates away and the plane was only 45 minutes late getting into Austin. Good job United. Unfortunately returning was a different story. I arrived at the Austin airport several hours early and inquired about an earlier flight to Houston. I was told that there had been no late flights all day. The plane arrived in Austin late and by the time I boarded it was 30 minutes late. Then it began raining in Houston so the plane had to wait another 20 minutes in Austin. By the time the plane arrived in Houston my flight to West Palm Beach had left and it was the last flight of the day. Most passengers on the full A319 flying east had to find a hotel for the night at their own expense because United is not responsible for weather related delays and it is usually raining somewhere where United flies. The next afternoon I was on an old regional plane with no first class seats to West Palm Beach.', \"united airlines Just returned from a round trip from London to Washington then New York San Francisco and finally Cancun and return.

Flights were delayed or cancelled they routinely have mechanical problems with their planes their flight crews have gotten worse and worse to the point that they often are just plain abusive their overseas business class is terrible and their ground crews are incompetent dishonest and often nasty. Unfortunately they have so many direct routes that you are stuck either flying United or taking another airline with a stop midway through your flight. If you have frequent flier miles with them good luck. You can almost never use your miles when you want to travel over the holidays or they charge some exorbitant number of miles. And now your miles will expire if you don't continue to fly with these people. United Airlines is a nightmare.\", 'united airlines My husband and I travelled from Newark NJ to Dubai with a stop over at Washington-Dulles. Newark flight was delayed and our Washington Dulles connection was missed.

In my job I average 175k miles of travel a year primarily with UA and their Star Alliance partners. As a 1K I enjoy personalized attention with UA such as automatic rebooking on cancelled flights or missed connections. I fly coach but with my status I frequently get upgrades domestically. Although I'm qualified for 6 global upgades a year that hasn't happened since 2010 when both my wife and SIL received Business Class seats MUC-ORD (prior to the merger with Continental). Unfortunate but could be a sign of the health of the economy that those seats are being purchased. At any rate I am very happy with the service I get from UA and even though I live near ORD I have had very few cancellations or delays of significance flying in or out of Chicago. Prices are competitive and schedules are great making it very easy to co-ordinate travel to Asia or Europe. While I fly Delta and SkyTeam partners occasionally I will fly UA and partners if at all possible.

I was told I couldn\\'t board the plane with my 4 month old infant because of weight restrictions on the plane. 6 people were told they couldn\\'t board the plane including myself and I found out that was based on our fares. I was penalized because I planned ahead and booked my ticket for less money. It doesn\\'t matter that I started my trip hours earlier or that I connected and arrived to the gate on time. Some kind soul did try to volunteer their seat. I overhead the gate crew saying there was a mother and baby who should board next which was superseded by the supervisor who said full fares trump everything.

The inflight entertainment and food were very poor compared to other airlines. No water bottles given out just cups. Cheap. The toilets were smelly and there was no amenity kit you see in other airlines.

They spent my valuable time chatting with one another amongst themselves at the counter and not warning anyone in line that there was a danger missing there flight or even showing effort to work faster. They did not attempt to even try make amends. Do not fly United out of Rochester NY they are the most unprofessional workers I have seen in this industry.', \"united airlines I have grown to despise flying after an early love affair with travel in the early 80's. That said the flight I was on from Dublin IR to IAD on a United 757 was excellent. We were in premium economy which made a huge difference on a 7+ hour flight.

The flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago was on \\'mechanical delay\\'. The \\'mechanical delay\\' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O\\'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said \"it\\'s departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight\". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight. One party is physically disabled. Unfortunately we did not make the flight and we missed the first half of the event that evening.

I checked to see if I could catch a flight from Melbourne to Christchurch but was told by a UA attendant that there were no more flights to Christchurch from Melbourne I was given a motel voucher for a night's stay and continued on to Christchurtch via NZ Airlines the next day.

In addition the level of service is not as good as Asian airlines that I've used on the same route such as Cathay Eva Air Singapore Air etc. When I asked to refill a water bottle the flight attendant said I would need to go to the galley myself to have it filled.

All upgrades cleared in advance allowing me to select my favourite seating which on United one can do free of charge. I continue to be impressed at the level of courtesy and service in United's premium cabins. The vast majority of cabin staff gave very good attentive and professional service. Good simple food but very enjoyable and well presented. The fish dishes continue to be my personal favourite and were quite delicious. Frequent drink refills no need to ask its just given. Some really outstanding flight attendants. Some customers dislike the business class seating personally I have no problem with it. After a nice meal and plenty of snooze inducing beverages I can literally sleep for hours. The only downside in the whole trip was the closure of Houston Airport as a result of thunderstorms on 16/04/15. This could not be avoided or blamed upon the airline. End result I arrived at Rio on my way back 24 hours late. As a 1k a free phone call to a dedicated phone line got me rebooked on the next days flight keeping the upgrade. But I have to say that I did not envy the legions of poor souls who had to stand in line at Houston Airport that night to receive the same service from customer service. It seemed like hundreds of passengers waiting to see one or two agents working at 2am and it was not a pretty sight! All in all thirteen long haul flights apart from the one delayed by weather all other flights operated either on time or ahead of schedule.

This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380).

Avoid this airline even if it offers attractive prices it is not worth it.', 'united airlines I flew to New Orleans from Toronto on Air Canada in business class on a cramped and ancient CRA jet which was very substandard compared to what it used to be and returned on United via Newark on a 320 Airbus which was surprisingly comfortable and superior to AC in every department and for nearly half the price than Air Canada charged for the outgoing trip. I will favour United over Air Canada in the future.', 'united airlines Flight 839 Los Angeles to Sydney 4th April 2015. Departed LA near enough on time flight uneventful until approx 3/4 hr before landing. We were informed by the Captain that because of bad weather we were to be diverted to Brisbane. In Brisbane we were told to stay on the plane until further notice. With only minutes to spare before the cut off time for Pilots and Crew expired we approached the runway for our return to Sydney. We only got half way when the Captain announced we were not going to take off as their time had expired. We were taken off the plane and told to wait until a new crew could be found. Almost 12 hrs later and a frustrating lack of information we were told that finally they had a crew but no pilot then we had a pilot but due to administration problems we could not leave. After a 15hr flight and 12 hrs sitting in an Airport we were all tired and at the end of our resolve. We finally arrived in Sydney with a loud applause from all of us passengers 27 hrs later.', 'united airlines I have taken several flights with United in the last 2 months (DEN-BOS-ORD-PHL-DEN and DEN-IAH). The online reviews are fairly awful but I have had overall decent to good experiences. All flights have arrived on time and early on a few occasions. Inflight service was overall good with smiling crews. Ground crews have also been reasonable good overall. I have found crews not based in EWR are in general a lot nicer. Inflight Internet worked well overall.', \"united airlines My son and I recently had a connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City. When we got off the plane the board said our flight had been cancelled. When we asked why they customer service representative told us that our flight had been chosen at random because of the weather. We were told to either wait at the airport for 12 hours or we could pay for a motel. In my opinion the motel should be provided if the airline has the ability to just randomly cancel flights. What a major inconvenience. The customer service rep was very rude and unaccommodating. I'll never fly united again.\", 'united airlines EWR-SJO-EWR. No-frills airline. All flights were on time but the seats were uncomfortable and cramped there was no free food in coach and the flight attendants were unpleasant and unprofessional. Ever since the merger service has declined and prices have gone up.', 'united airlines I made my reservation months in advance. I was supposed to have an aisle seat about 5 seats from the back of the plane. When I boarded the plane I was not in that seat. Instead I was put in the very last row by the toilet. I had work to do and tried to power through it despite the terrible seat. The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get \"placed\" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn\\'t eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn\\'t even seem to notice. On the plus side it was terribly windy and the pilot did a good job with the landing.', 'united airlines I booked a last minute trip from Orlando FL to Hong Kong. The price was OK for few days notice but the in-flight experience was one I would like to forget. In the past I flew overseas with other international airlines from abroad and most treated me and my family very good. With United it was my worst experience flying overseas. Flew from Orlando via Newark to Hong Kong direct. The seats were hard as a rock which made it very hard to sleep. The entertainment system offered all these channels and music that did not work and not available for viewing. The food was terrible and small. It was half the size of a lean cuisine dinner. They charged me $8.00 for a half a can of beer. The attitude of the flight attendants were rude. Returning back to Orlando via Chicago from Hong Kong the flight was an hour and a half late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Orlando. Got no sympathy from service desk and was stuck in Chicago for an extra 4 hours. I will not fly United ever again. Its not only bad service they provide but bad attitudes and they want to change you for every single little amenity. Avoid this airline if you can.', 'united airlines BRU-ORD-BRU. On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small. For dinner I ordered the pasta which was dough and something like tomato sauce not very tasty. Legroom was better than on most Asian airlines and attendants were courteous and caring. I see no reason why I should not take United again.', \"united airlines The flight is always too full for everyone's carry on baggage. I don't like having to make sure I'm first in line to get onboard just so I know I don't have to check my bag.

It's one step too far.\", 'united airlines ORD (Chicago) to OGG (Maui). They notified us that there would be no wi-fi on the flight. Fine. We had media- filled devices so we could tolerate the 9-hour flight. OGG to ORD wi-fi was \\'available\\' but none of our devices (Android and iOS) would connect. Loading for the sign-in page would stop at 80% at the highest but then would hang. Forget about it. Take-off was delayed for loading of \\'catering supplies\\' (food that would be sold to us?). Flight attendants are always rude as if clearly they would rather be doing something other than attending.

Hello Alaska Airlines.', 'united airlines ORD (Chicago O\\'Hare) to OGG (Maui Kahului) round trip. To Maui it was announced that the flight (a B777) would not have wi-fi. Luckily we brought our own electronic devices loaded with media to watch or read on.

The home-leg departure was delayed for loading of catering supplies (i.e. food that would be for sale?). Flight attendants are rude as if you were sitting in their furniture without asking. It\\'s easy to use polite language and manners even if you\\'re not sincere yet they could not muster a minimum effort. The price for this flight is quite high as much as ORD to an Asian destination but it seems more like a budget flight. I guess it\\'s because it\\'s a straight flight (no lay-overs). Next time I will try Alaska Air with one stop-over at a much lower price (less than half!).', 'united airlines My husband is a frequent flyer with United Airlines in his personal and business travels without incident. In saying that I am a reasonable person I can understand that our flight was delayed and then cancelled due to mechanical problem. However the rudeness of the ticket agents was a total shock to me and most of the other passengers. Staff did not seem to be equipped to handle helping people re-route their flights and were flustered and unprofessional. It is very difficult for me to express my disappointment in the way the situation was handled. The only apologies we received were from the airport security officers who showed up at gate 29. There were no announcements stating that they (the ticket agents) were going to help us with connecting flights there were no apologies for the inconvenience of having to sleep in the airport no announcement that first class passengers and those with small children would be found hotel rooms and others would be left to their own devices to sleep at the gate. Some water and sodas were provided but not enough for everyone. The ticket agents seemed to be \"put out\" in trying to help us. Isn\\'t that their job? I believe that customer service is a huge part of any business and if you don\\'t have good customer service you have nothing. No food vouchers were offered unless asked for this I found out by asking a fellow passenger where he had received his vouchers.It should have been announced that everyone would receive these after a long night sleeping at the gate. The lack of communication was shameless and again unprofessional! I believe there needs to be some training with the staff at United Airlines Maui to help in dealing with situations such as cancelled flights and exhausted guests. And regarding the 125.00 voucher we received for the inconvenience of this debacle doesn\\'t come close to compensating for the discomfort and inconvenience of having to sleep on a filthy airport floor! Horrible customer service made the situation even worse.', \"united airlines Recently flew SFO-IAH-EWR then EWR-ORD-SFO. First class cabin every flight. United's 737-900 series aircraft are nice but the leg room provided hardly warrants first class. Wifi failed on every leg except SFO-IAH. If you navigate off the personal entertainment offering to wifi it is impossible to get back. So if the wifi fails - which it often does on United - you have nothing. Meals were improved over past on a couple of legs the same poor food as on the others. Wines still bad. Boarding ridiculous as Group 1 is now huge with no preference to First Class. I've flown the airline for years because of its dominance at SFO but take other Star Alliance airlines when going overseas. United had delays on both parts of return whereas others I knew on Jet Blue out of JFK (down a runway) got out on time. May be time to give up my 1K and go elsewhere.\", \"united airlines I had my first and hopefully last experience with United Airlines this past week. I flew round trip to Orlando with a friend for spring break. Our flight down was delayed three hours because of weather which is admittedly not United's fault however we missed a connection in D.C. and had to fly standby on a later flight that put us at our destination 6 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The return flight was the real terror though. Our first leg from Orlando to Chicago was fine except for the airline insisting on checking our carry ons through to the final destination. Once in Chicago we were told our flight to Burlington was delayed due to mechanical problems. Eventually we boarded the flight an hour late and took off. We then turned back and circled O'Hare for an hour and a half due to mechanical problems before making an emergency landing and having to get off the plane. They then cancelled that flight after leaving us sitting for two hours while they tried to find another aircraft. At that point I was told there was no way to get me to Burlington before Sunday night (my original flight was Friday morning). I tried to book a flight to a nearby city and was told it was impossible to fly anything other than standby. I was booked on a confirmed seat to Albany for Saturday morning and tried two standby flights Friday night. My friend made it out but I ended up in the airport overnight (I was not offered accommodation). When I went to board my flight Saturday morning they informed me that there had been an error and the flight was overbooked. I was bounced from that flight and booked on one departing in the afternoon. The afternoon flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems and I was unable to get out until Saturday night at 11 pm. After all that they refused to even consider shipping my bag until I had landed in Albany (it had been shipped to Burlington on Friday). It is now Monday and I still have not received my bags. Their customer service is unfriendly unhelpful and refuses to let you speak to someone in charge. I will never fly United again and I discourage anyone from doing so unless they don't mind spending hours in an airport without their luggage.\", 'united airlines I booked my trip from UK to Florida via Newark over 8 months ago.

The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendantsâ€¦- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation. Breakfast was down right disgusting. Maybe this is because on the way to China I flew with ANA and the service is excellent and incomparable.

At Denver they shuffled us back and forth between customer service and the boarding gate finally they ended up booking us on a flight to Oahu then Hawaiian Airlines to Kona. When we arrived in Oahu they had no record of us saying United did not have us booked to Kona. After waiting for everyone to board they were able to get us on. We arrived in Kona approx. 6.5 hrs after we expected to missing a 1/2 a day of our vacation time any activities we had booked and no luggage! Our luggage arrived about 11pm at night. Our return flight was not any better. We arrived at the airport early and was told they had a flight leaving shortly and room on it. With our Kona bound experience we thought it may be a good idea to have more time. Before we boarded they had hydraulic problems and the flight was delayed.

So we waited and for once we made it in time for our connecting flight to Denver until we boarded the plane and the starter went out on the plane they brought it back in fixed it but not before we missed our connecting flight from Denver to Omaha. By now we were wondering if this was normal for United? At Denver again we were shuffled around until they finally found a flight into Omaha for us. Our flight experience with United was well below satisfactory levels. The maintenance issues should be a concern for United.

United had mechanical issues on flight 234 but after many delay announcements it took them until about noon to cancel the flight. We sat on the plane for a short while then for many hours in the airport until they cancelled it. Then we had to go all the way back out to check-in to wait in a line for about another 2 hours to be told there were no flights at BWI to Houston that day. United employees were few and far between not nearly enough to handle the re-booking of an entire flight. Eventually we were bussed to the Dulles airport for a 4.30 flight to Houston. We were not given any food and United employees were short-tempered and quite helpless. I heard other passengers say they received food vouchers so I couldn't help but wonder why we were not given anything. Maybe it was because we were Travelocity customers rather than direct customers with United or maybe it was because we were very easy and never mouthy or difficult with anyone. On our flight from Dulles to IAH I was seated in a middle seat separated from my husband which was very difficult because of all the turbulence and my motion sickness.

Why do we need food and beverage when the flight is 2 hours and everyone wants to leave without it? This is poor service poor planning and poor management. We will not be flying United anymore. I have never had this issue with such a short domestic flight. Unfortunately we had to fly United because we had to travel for a funeral and these were the only flights.

On the return trip our flight was delayed out of Punta Cana by an hour. This created a very short window of time to catch our connecting flight in Philadelphia.

The next available flight was at 9.45 the next morning.

After calling the number on the card that this upstanding United Airlines representative had so generously given us we learned that the nearest hotel we could stay at was 50 miles away.

There is no room for peoples legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples health. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants beyond rude.

I found a United staff member who told us that the door had been changed to #23. We went out and there were 4 buses. No one knew what we were saying as they did not speak English.

Plus to make matters worse for some bizarre reason Grand Cayman will not let you go through security with a fly rod despite having flown all around the world with one and no problem from any other security. So now this has to be checked which becomes a 2nd checked bag at $40. $40 for a couple 30\" long by 1 1.2\" diameter tubes taped together! At least that one was only on the return leg. I travel a lot and while I cant say I will never fly United again since there are limited options anymore but it will flat out have to be my only option to a place I really want to go to. They even require you to pay if you wanted to watch the flight information screen which is just a GPS screen with a plane drawn on it showing where you are on a map! They have always been bad now they are abusive.', 'united airlines July 21st 2014 on UAL Flight 111. As a general fact I like United Airlines. I liked Continental a lot so United when acting under the Continental side is wonderful. However I got a bit more \"tulip\" and less \"globe\" on my flight from Miami to Newark. The check-in and gate agents were wonderful as usual but the flight was delayed two hours before taking off from Miami. I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United\\'s horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80\\'s synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming. If I\\'m flying in and out of Newark a former Continental hub I deserve Continental service. Let Chicagoans keep their United I\\'ll keep my Continental.', 'united airlines I flew from Sky Harbour to San Francisco for a connecting flight to China. As per other American Airlines United really is a cattle truck delivery. On both flights with United you had to check any items larger than a backpack at the gate often by a grumpy employee. The flight was okay but the cabin attendant look like she was going out shopping for the day United really lacks class on all level.', 'united airlines Terrible experience flying UA from SFO to IAD. Very poor customer service all along the continuum. First my return seat assignment was changed from an aisle to middle seat without my knowledge (no one would correct the error by phone) then there was a 5 hour delay leaving SFO. Upon arrival at IAD we found our luggage had been loaded on a different plane that would not arrive at Dulles for another hour. Because of the 5-hour delay it was almost midnight at this point. The next day we had to go in search of our own luggage at the \"lost luggage\" distribution center. United Customer service staff was of no help. Talk about the unfriendly skies.', \"united airlines Cheap cheap cheap. Golly how expensive would it be to let people watch the TV news on an all-day plane ride or allow 'free' Wi-Fi which is free everywhere else in the western world? A few snacks anything? Had a lovely cheerful flight attendant between San Francisco to Newark but all the airline nickel-and-diming takes all the fun out of what used to be half the fun: getting there-or back. It's as though they hate their passengers and make the trips as miserable as possible seats too narrow for a normal rear end aisles two skeletons could not pass in no place to put your legs if you have two seats that recline an inch and a half charges for even a small bag everything. Back to cars and trains or staying home I think it is just too exhausting and annoying and expensive to fly anymore.\", \"united airlines My wife and I flew business/first class on United Airlines from Maui to Denver with a plane change in LAX. Our flight on 2/5/2015 from Maui to LAX was UA417 an ancient 757-200. We paid a total of $4924.40 for two round trip tickets. Flight 417 was more like riding an old dusty city bus. Keeping in mind that we were in first class we were offered only a small bag of potato chips. That was it. We were told that there were no more snacks and we could have only one bag of chips. The flight attendants mainly sat in their jump seats the whole time just chatting or snoozing. The purser was pretty snotty when asked any questions. We had the old style seats that didn't recline much. And beyond our belief on the ongoing flight from LAX to DEN we had lay-flat beds. For a flight lasting less than two hours. We sure could have used those lay-flat beds for the over-ocean portion. We've avoided United for several years now and from now on will continue to avoid them.\", \"united airlines Recently flew from Sydney to the US on United and a bunch of internal flights within US and returning home on United. Read a lot of negative reviews about United before I travelled so was a bit sceptical about the whole experience. I'm an average meat and three veg type of guy if I pay a beer price I don't expect to get Champagne service. Who does? I was more than happy with the service provided given the fares I paid. I recall only once one of the internal flights was delayed and it really wasn't a big deal. I would definitely fly with United again. I really think some people need to get a grip they want silver service for bargain basement prices. You get what you pay for and I was more than happy with United. No hesitation to fly with them again.\", \"united airlines Travel from Newark to BOM direct and back Delhi to Newark direct. Paid for extra leg room but didn't feel much different. Food leaving Newark was good. On way back from India it was terrible. The veg breakfast was not edible. On return at Newark they could not unload checked bags for over two hours. Those with connections missed them. No apologies were made or compensation provided. In the future will prefer any other airline to United and are considering canceling our United credit card. Worst airline in business today.\", \"united airlines Flying UA in F (oxymoron alert) from ORD to NRT. Our 13-hour flight was delayed for three hours after we had boarded because of radio issues. About 30 minutes into the wait they opened up the main door and with temps outside around zero the F cabin quickly became a freezer. I could actually see the breath of the pax in 4A. The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The â€œsausageâ€\\x9d that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles. Service was not rude for the most part but below economy standards on any Asian carrier. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of dishwater coffee. When the woman seated next to me asked what the squid sushi was the FA replied (with a smile to be fair) â€œDon't ask me I don't make it.â€\\x9dThe shoulder harness that F pax are required to wear on takeoff and landing was extremely uncomfortable. When I remarked on this (politely and with a smile) to the FA while putting mine on she patronizingly replied â€œWe can endure anything for a few minutes Mr. Johnson.â€\\x9dWill never ever fly United long-haul again.\", \"united airlines I have flown United my whole life. It had been ten years since I had flown. This last week we flew from the mid west to the pacific coast using nothing but United. It's natural to have delays from weather related issues but We didn't have any to worry about. What has completely destroyed my desire to fly anywhere again is the complete lack of planning customer service and treatment from all the personnel we had contact with. Our delays service and vacation was substandard because we chose this airline. I will not recommend this airline to anyone.\", 'united airlines Overall based on a round-trip flight between IAD and SFO I would give United 0 stars. On the outbound leg there was a medical emergency on-board and the United flight crew was totally unprepared to handle the situation. If a medical kit was on-board it wasn\\'t made available to the medical personnel who tried to provide assistance and it took 15 minutes for the Flight attendant to bring a wet towel to help cool the patient down. Our return flight was delayed by almost 5 hours with not even \"we apologize\" for the delay from United. Then our bags were placed on a different flight that didn\\'t arrive until 1 hours after our flight and the bags didn\\'t show up at the airport until 4 hours after we landed. Again no apologies from United. then we got numerous texts from United about the status of our bags. One even claimed the bags arrived at IAD 2 hours before we did. Most of the customer support folks at the Baggage Claim customer support were surly and not the kind of people who should be working in customer support.', 'united airlines SFO-HND/NRT-SFO in First. The outbound flight was so not First Class. The crew never addressed anyone by name-I think there were 6 of us and when my aisle mate had trouble finding the chest belt the FA motioned and pointed rather than walking to the seat to assist. The dinner was OK but there was no style in its presentation-or of any of the meal. The crew was present when necessary but had no real interaction with any passengers that I observed. The breakfast was insipid. Again poorly presented eggs lukewarm and the potato patty was soggy and blah as was the some-kind-of sausage patty. All in all it was a simply so far off the \"First Class\" moniker that I arrived feeling nothing but annoyance. The return from Narita was much better. United still lacks any sense of presentation or style but the crew was friendly present and engaged. The meals were both better than those on the inbound more tasty and hot but still far off the mark that is achieved by other airlines not only in First but even in Business. I used miles but had I paid the full freight I would have been furious at what was delivered. I will give UA credit for its hard product. The seat is comfortable and has plenty of storage area and the IFE is good.', 'united airlines From the moment we tried to check in at the Spokane Airport until our return from Costa Rica a week later we felt like we were just a major inconvenience to the entire Airline.

When I asked what was on their food menu for purchase another roll of the eyes and was informed it was in the book in front of me. Leaving the plane you could almost hear the flight crew heave a sigh of relief the flight was over and they were rid of us the entire plane load. We were pried into our seats with a shoe horn and never in all my travels have I felt so claustrophobic - the 3 hour leg of the trip was almost unbearable to sit through.

Actually really surprised at the comfort of the seat despite all the negative press about the new Slimline product. Of course this flight was only about 30 minutes but for a regional hop not bad at all. Continuing segment was on A319 in F. Seat was moderately comfortable but pitch was lacking and by the end of this 3 hour flight I was definitely eager to deplane. Service was attentive and professional however and drinks were consistently refilled. Food could have been better but what else is new. Overall I was pleased with this journey and despite being loyal to AA would consider UA again if traveling to one of their hub cities.', 'united airlines I have no idea why they call travelling United \"flying the friendly skies\". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren\\'t even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane\\'s systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded \"Oh yes I know I could not understand him either\". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no \"enjoy your meal\" no \"what would you like\" just appalling \"what do you want\" and throwing it at your table - truly \"the friendly sky\"! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little \"sorry\" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not. Since United has obviously different point of view in this regard I will avoid flying them next time.', 'united airlines From the moment we tried to check in at the Spokane Airport until our return from Costa Rica a week later we felt like we were just a major inconvenience to the entire Airline.

Even the remark that I travel on First Class did nothing. The lady in the lounge claimed that the United Passes I got from Chase were falsified! They were not as UA customer service later confirmed. The flight itself was a horrible experience: None of very old blue leather seats in First Class reclined. There were no foot-rest (which is standard even in many Economy Classes around the world - for example on Turkish Airlines). The United First Class Seat was at least 30 years old with a sealed armrest ashtray. The food was horrible and cold and a stewardess did not know the difference between white wine and champagne. The Video system on my seat had no audio. The much touted \"Wi-Fiâ€\\x9d did not work - I could not connect. I conveyed to UAL that they should not use such equipment on long-haul flights.

Never again.', 'united airlines In-flight service is long out the window video entertainment is endless infomercials and the last scraps of legroom have vanished into thin air. On a recent full flight from Newark to Los Angeles a new super skinny seating was encountered that climbs to a whole new altitude of pain and suffering. When reputable airlines change to slim seats the airline gets more seats on the plane and passengers get a bit more legroom but at United this would never fly. United now using Continentals short-haul 737-900s on long-haul routes has extra extra seats that donâ€™ t quite fit. To make passable exit row clearance seats behind are compacted to even less than their typical 30-inch seat pitch on this aircraft - less than the 31-inches specified for many other flights - and much less than the 32-inches United advertises when selling economy seats. My seat had only 2-feet clear butt-to-shin with perhaps an additional 4-inch knee-high seatback thickness - probably a 28-inch pinch - or less! When the passenger in front tried repeatedly to recline - there being no extra room it was impossible. The passenger drew a cabin attendant to complain that I would not allow the seat to recline. The attendant seriously explained to me that the passenger had purchased a ticket entitling them to my leg space and may fully recline the seat. Unfazed the attendant told me that if I wanted extra legroom I should have purchased anâ€œEconomy-Plusâ€\\x9d seat. I asked how much it would cost but there were no free seats - at any price. I explained that I did not need extra legroom just sufficient room - which they were not providing. Not reconciled to the laws of physics the attendant continued insisting that this was all my fault - that I was taking up space that I was not entitled to - and had me turn sideways putting my knees in the aisle so the seat could recline. My shoulder was now in the way of the seat. I could not turn back either and complained that the vending carts would hurt my legs even more than the seatback. Only then did the attendant finally suggest that the other passenger switch seats with their adjacent small child. For $25 a luggage bag had more space than me - and was treated much better!', \"united airlines My family and I flew United for the last time over the holidays.

A few weeks before our trip we received an email telling us that our flights had all been changed. Now we were leaving hours earlier getting in hours later with stopovers both ways. These flights were on Christmas day and New Year's Eve - clearly a few hours made a huge difference. Also our seats were no longer together. I will never fly United again. Customer service is terrible.\", \"united airlines Never again will my family and I fly with United Airlines! We flew in from Sacramento to San Fran and we missed the connecting flight to Hawaii because of their delays.

On the way back from Hawaii we had a flight connecting us from LAX to Sacramento but missed it once more because we were sitting on the Tarmac for 40 minutes doing nothing. There were no more flights to SAC so we had to spend the night in LA. My husband 2 sons and I are now missing work and my 2 other children are missing school. Missing the flight once was bad enough but a second one is totally unacceptable. Both times the planes we needed to get on were sitting there and we were only late by minutes and they wouldn't let us on. We missed a whole day in Hawaii because of it. Also on the flight with UN from Hawaii to LA there was no complimentary food.\", \"united airlines MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.\", 'united airlines Flight 914 from CDG to MCI with connection at Washington Dulles on Jan 14 in Economy class. The product featured by United is sub-standard. Of course ageing aircraft in the main leg (767) is clean and well maintained and this is the minimum you can expect from one of the largest airlines in the world. Check-in boarding operations baggage everything ok. Seats are standard. VOD is poor with very limited options and not user friendly. The music program was out of order for this flight and films not plenty. Besides on individual screens maps are not detailed and this system is less advanced than 20 years ago (I am not joking) in Asian companies. Also flight information is given exclusively in feet inches miles just if the metric system does not exist in the rest of the world! Regarding meals they are almost edible. We had chicken with some sauce (more sweet than sour) a large salad with a too smallish cup of dressing (good) and a kind of sponge cake pompously christened crumble â€“ wrapped in a cello paper printed European quality but made in Alabama. All in a very small slippy tray complimented with picnic cutlery (100% plastic). And of course passengers have to pay 7.99 $ for one beer. Ridiculous. By the way a sandwich (not bad) was served before landing but do not expect more than water between meal and snack. Fruit juices ice creams and other open bar is a dream out of reach at United. Attitude of cabin crew very professional (attendants have apparently about 20/25 years experience) working efficiently but not cheerful (friendly skies really?) in very bland uniforms which could be copied from Railways of the 70â€™ Being familiar with Asian and Middle East airlines I find United well below what you may expect from such a large corporation.', \"united airlines United Premium Economy is a gamble it seems to be directly dependent on the type of aircraft you are flying. On a 777 the seats are nice and spacious the services (seatback entertainment) are premium and you can really feel the extra legroom making the extra charge totally worthwhile. On a 747 the opposite is true I had more room in Economy on an Airbus than I did in Premium Economy on a 747. On the 747 I couldn't even fit my very small backpack under the seat in front of me and what little legroom I had was obstructed by a large piece of plastic. The aisles were noticeably narrower as well which made every beverage service an exercise in getting smacked with a cart (not fun on a 13 hour flight). I did notice there was an extra seat in every row on the 747 which is probably were all that extra room went. Also relying on the old school movie screens meant that even if you were trying to sleep a bright light was shining in your face. On the bright side as always the crew were nice courteous and professional. Long story short though? If you're going to spring for the Economy Plus make sure you're on the right type of plane it makes a big difference.\", \"united airlines We had truly horrible service from the first flight out to the last flight of the return trip. United booked us to fly into Newark to connect with a flight out of JFK - we got the joy of finding this out when we checked in. On the return flight from Zurich the cabin crew announced that they were short staffed due to management cut- backs. Translation in our case where we were seated near the rear of the plane is that we got one small sandwich six hours into the flight. I would have killed for a glass of water and maybe some food. Then our connecting flight to Raleigh was cancelled due to 'weather' and therefore we were responsible for our own sleeping arrangements. The 'weather' in Raleigh was drizzle. Our bags went American and arrived on time. A complaint to United was not even met with an apology. Instead they offered of a $100 voucher for future travel with them!\", \"united airlines I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program. So my review is of a recent flight this last summer but also of their frequent flyer plan which unless you are a Business flyer I would avoid. It's almost impossible to move up to Gold with them. I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United. Needless to say I am now with the FF program of Turkish Airlines and will never fly United again unless it's impossible due to US monopolistic practices. Don't fly United.\", 'united airlines I flew to London on the so called \"Dreamliner\". United is so bad they have now changed out the seats in coach to the same tiny seats for short commuter flights. United plus is not a better seat or service just more leg room which is the least of the issues unless your over 6 feet tall. Beer and Wine are now $7 each! They are free on European airlines with more comfortable seats. I used to be bothered when they cancelled direct flights from Houston to Paris. Now I don\\'t have to chose between United and Air France!', 'united airlines LAX-MEL - B787-8 - Overall a good flight. Equipment changed from a B787-9 to a B787-8. Not too disappointed since it was still a Dreamliner but the change to the smaller aircraft had the consequence that a baby was moved from the forward business class to the 3 Business rows in the mid-section. A baby on 16 hrs flight - not recommended. Flight departed from LAX 1.5 hr late. Basically waited on board for 1.5 hrs. Everyone had already boarded so we were in this plane for at least 17 hrs. Flight uneventful new Dreamliner is a really great airplane large windows very airy cabin. Seat is good except that not every seat has direct aisle access. Inflight Entertainment great good selection of movies TV shows. Service was attentive (above usual United average) Food was decent. Unfortunately United does not supply their Business customers with Fast passes for Melbourne Airport Immigration so waited almost 1 hr to get through on top of the 1.5 hr delay. All in all a great plane and can recommend if you are traveling to Melbourne.', 'united airlines I am currently sitting on the flight that was supposed to depart at 6.05 am from NY to Dayton. It is 6.40 am and we have not taken off. We have been sitting on the plane for almost an hour due to \"maintenance issues.\" I am not going to make my connection and this is after the exact same issue on the flight I took to NY. I was sceptical to book a flight with United based on anecdotal experience with friends and family but now I am experiencing it first hand on both legs of the trip. The first flight of the day and it is delayed? It is evident how United does business. By the way no word on when we are leaving.', 'united airlines TLV-ORD via EWR business first. Comfortable seat and was able to sleep for 7 hours. Dinner OK good entree nice service. Seats flat and convenient. Breakfast OK. Catering could be better but reasonable.

EWR United club nice showers and service from club staff but mediocre offering of snacks.', 'united airlines EDI-EWR UA37 on B757-200 aircraft on the last day of 2014. (Part of a â€˜Pâ€™fare booking EDI/EWR/PBI and return). Checked-in at the dedicated business class desk and was advised that UAL use the â€˜Aspireâ€™ lounge at EDI. The lounge was fine with a reasonable selection of food items for a snack breakfast. Flights are not called from the lounge. Boarding appeared to be well managed a number of supplementary security / travel questions were asked by an agent at the gate. Once onboard a welcome drink of champagne juice or water was offered. There is a 2-2 flatbed seat configuration in Business Class. The seat was comfortable with plenty of space and easy-to-use chair and In Flight Entertainment controls. The plane Departed on time at 09.05. On board service began roughly 45 minutes after departure. The main meal was lunch followed by a snack prior to arrival at EWR. In my opinion this is where UAL need to put more thought into what is offered. In view of the time of day prior to 10.00 a full breakfast or brunch rather than a lunch might have been a better catering option? The service from flight attendants was efficient although some of them appeared to be a bit tired looking. Small touches such as addressing passengers by name were absent on this flight. This was done on the inbound UA36 EWR-EDI 8 Jan 15 in comparison. The flight arrived at EWR around 35minutes ahead of schedule this was partly due to an on board medical emergency situation. Overall the flight was a pleasant and efficient experience. I would use UAL again in Business Class subject to obtaining a fare at a suitable price!', 'united airlines UA163 GUM-ICN 1/5/2015. We sat in the airplane 1.5 hours before departure due to a missing logbook. Add 5.5 hours to destination makes 7 hours total time in ac. Breakfast was served it was small and below standard. Flight attendants were hard to find for any extra drinks. 2.5 hours prior to destination captain turned on fasten seat belts sign due to turbulence hence terminating inflight service. There was no turbulence we were on top of the cloud layer. There was no turbulence during descent as well. I feel the seat belt sign was turned on to avoid further service to passengers. Inflight entertainment was poor quality. The small movie screen had continuous static making it impossible to watch.', 'united airlines SFO-IAH B767-300. Seat broken not inclining. No advise at check-in that would allow a change before upgrade list to be activated. Lounge as a nice view but nothing to eat and bar is paid. Went to Singapore Airlines one. Much better.', \"united airlines MAN to EWR RT BusinessFirst. I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years. Shame but they just don't deserve my business anymore.\", 'united airlines This was my first and last time flying with United. I am a frequent Delta and Southwest traveler and was beyond disappointed with my experience on United. Our second flight was cancelled and it took someone over 15 minutes to inform us of this cancellation-additionally I was not notified via their app about this cancellation. It was 10am and they claimed they had no way to get us home that day unless we spent $80 to take a shuttle to another airport and then took two more flights from there. They then charged us three times for our bags. Overall (not including the two extra bag charges) this cost us an additional $180 and they refused to pay for a cent. I will never fly this airline again. Also as a side note as we spent the entire day in the airport we noticed that they overbooked every single flight some flights were overbooked by more than 10 people! Terrible airline-poor customer service and extra fees for everything (snacks bags television etc.)', \"united airlines IAH-GIG-B767/400. In the morning on United Airlines on-line check-in I could see that Aircraft would not be a 777 but a 767. At night on departure mess was absolute. Seats had been re-marked separating couples etc.. Departure was delayed 2 hours due to Cargo issues resulting of Aircraft change (which was NOT unexpected). Late 1h45 mn at arrival in Rio. No Amenities pouch (why?). Unacceptable food for International Business class: Ugly and dry. Overcooked. IFE was the same as 2 months before. How ? Seat remains flat and comfortable. FA's tried their best but passengers were upset.\", \"united airlines On our way back from Cancun we had a stopover in Houston. The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures. I travel back and forth from the United States just to Canada alone at least 7x (round trip) a year. We recommend you stay away from this airline.\", 'united airlines Dallas - New York - Stockholm. I have previously promised to never fly United again after a couple of extremely poor flight and customer care experiences. Now I end up on two United flights once again because that seemed to be the only option. This time the experience was slightly better. The staff is still a bit grumpy the entertainment system is below average the food is among the worst I have had in the air and the check-in processes are a bit strange. Nevertheless I ended up coming home on time without being too frustrated!', \"united airlines Flying now United Airlines round the world starting from Europe. Never again on a UA flight unless it is the last choice. They started me on a feeder flight from Oslo to Frankfurt only to tell me that they pushed me 24 hours on their flight to Chicago because they simply cancelled the flight that day. I did not accept and got across with Air Canada but ended in Toronto rather than USA. Had 5 internal flights in the US scheduled time seems an approximate time not a target for UA. I boarded in Washington on UA803 via Japan with same flight number going to Singapore. After boarding we sat excess 15 hours in the plane awaiting for UA to finish their maintenance. Arrived Tokyo only about 40 minutes late but was told too late to board the 803 flight to Singapore. On arrival I had a good 30 minutes and only hand luggage. Tough luck same flight number means 2 different airplanes on the two legs and no margin to be late crossing the Pacific. 6 hours waiting with shifting to Haneda. Business class and Star Alliance Gold card means nothing to UA's level of service. Never UA again.\", \"united airlines I flew from San Francisco to Managua and the overall value and service was typical for United. United has the worst food and in-flight entertainment in the industry. The flight attendants want to serve you food immediately after the flight begins so they can chatter in the forward and rear galleys of the airplane. Low fat potato chips and cookies are not a snack they are the lowest cost food options that you can offer your customers. United Airlines overall is of the worst carriers for inflight services in the airline industry. I was in Business/First and they wanted me to pay for both the internet and DirectTV why don't you just consider me a customer that hates your airlines and that will avoid you at all costs.\", 'united airlines Newark to Fort Lauderdale on 13th January 2015.

What lets them down in the complete disinterest and discourtesy of their staff from check in and throughout the journey. No smiles no interaction no welcome on boarding just generally no customer interaction at all.

I am sure the airlines would say not our fault but it was late planes. Mechanical failures that blocked gates.

Two guys booked on the flight decided to drive to Indy because it would be faster than flying. Not a ringing endorsement.\", \"united airlines My husband and I traveled using ANA from Winnipeg - Bangkok then Toronto - Chicago and the Chicago-Toyko Narita flights were on United. We upgrade to Premium Economy for the 13 hour flight for comfort. Immediately we were grounded for 2.5 hours because the plane wouldn't accept the fuel. So all passengers including us who had to transfer in Narita were going to be late. Once finally in the air all audio wouldn't work. To add insult - the stove and cooking equipment wouldn't work either! For this 13 hour flight the attendants served us frozen turkey sandwiches with ice cream. United staff did announce to everyone that they were sorry for the poor service. They did pay for our hotel we were checked in at 3am and had to been on the next flight at 8am. The good news was the flight from Singapore to Bangkok was on Singapore Airlines. They are always in the top 5 airlines in the world for a good reason. On this 2.5 hour flight we had much better service. United needs to completely overhaul their policies from top to bottom.\", 'united airlines LAS-SFO B737-900 and SFO-SYD B777-200.

The HNL flight was over an hour late in departure. On our return trip on 18th June 2014 the HNL-IAD flight was more than 2 hours late and the connecting flight to LHR on 19th June was boarded then disembarked as the plane was faulty - and we ended up with a 3 hour delay.

Brought my own entertainment so I had an excellent flight (should have brought earplugs though). EWR-PHX on newly refurbished A319 with slimline seats.

PHX-EWR on 737-700 also with new interior and AVOD. However this is provided by DirecTV cost is $5.99 for flight of two hours or less and $7.99 for flight of more than 2 hours. Sadly even the flight information part is enclosed here so you don\\'t see it unless you pay for it. Again two drink runs and good service by nice flight crew. Of the four planes on this trip this one had the worst legroom but still OK. EWR-ZRH on 767-400. Old plane with brand new interior - and a good one at that. Slimline seats with a big screen in front of you a large choice of new movies games and shows. Legroom again very good the 31in. at United appear to be bigger inches than those on other airlines. Tasty dinner and small breakfast (with fresh fruit!). After reading many bad reviews I had mixed feelings about stepping into a United plane. I even considered doling out the (quite big amount of) $$ for Premium Economy. But I got corrected. All planes were clean and well maintained nothing rattled or fell of. The crews were all nice and helpful. Legroom was never an issue even with pax in front of me reclining. After this experience I highly recommend United.

No snacks offered (I guess they are worried people will fill up on these having tasted the food) although available to purchase and no complimentary alcohol. Attendants fairly average and could certainly do with a better corporate uniform on trip out. On way back distinctly poor. Most worrying was the man who was on our plane and about 20 mins before take- off realized he was on the wrong flight only when somebody else came to sit in his seat.

In other word the 16 nonrevenue upgrades get their choice compared to the schmuck without a lot of status who used real money (and not a small amount).', 'united airlines It\\'s shocking how bad this airline can be. Flying out of Chicago-the United hub-we were delayed 2 hours while maintenance searched for a \"no go\" part to secure the carts in the galley. How such an apparently essential part was unavailable anywhere on the O\\'Hare property is unbelievable. It was a completely preventable delay and yet we received no apology from the crew.', \"united airlines Late into Denver switched to Late flight to Chicago but they dropped our names off the seating chart so we all had spread out horrible seats given a motel in Chicago turned out to be a scam (had to pay for motel) because no more final destination flights until next day. Some very nice service but mostly very unfriendly rude horrible service people work for United. On way back same thing. Two hour delay for final destination and had to get another room waiting for guess. Which led us to meet another rude service person in customer service dept.

I was appalled at the service or lack of! No food or drink service at all and this was in First Class! Ground crew at Seattle were terribly rude and should not even be employed in the service industry. United is the worst airline I have had the misfortune to travel on!', 'united airlines Sat in 24D on an Airbus 320 from Seattle to Newark. This is a standard aisle seat located on the right side of the aircraft just a few rows behind the over-wing exit rows. It is one of what I call the \"back-of-the-bus\" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth leg space and comfort. If you are 5\\' 10\" or less in height or a somewhat taller person with short legs you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words you don\\'t have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or are frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately for me the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). The staff appeared competent and the service itself was decent. The plane appeared relatively clean and well- maintained. Lamentably there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever which seems to be the trend on the smaller Airbus and Boeing aircraft operated by United. To reiterate my earlier comment this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.', \"united airlines My wife and I travelled first class from Orlando to Newark recently. We were surprised to see there were no PTVs on the plane. When it was time for meal service we were told there was chicken dinner or a salad. We both don't eat chicken so we ordered salads - we were told they were out of salads. Policy for the 12 first class seats - 6 salads and 6 chicken dishes. Out of luck! We had cookies for dinner.\", \"united airlines Orlando to Denver to Edmonton - because we had problems printing our boarding passes we went to airport and a courteous member of staff printed off our boarding passes for us. Because of that today we simply walked to security and went through. We only had 1 carry on bag each and one pack sack each. The staff announced that we could take our carry on bag and they put tags on each of them for us and we dropped them off at the circle just as you boarded the plane. Our bags went straight through to Edmonton. Due to technical problems we left about 1/2 hour late but that was ok. Before we got off the staff read off the gate of connecting flights. That saved everyone a whole lot of time. We made it to our next plane - had about 10 minutes and that plane had to wait for our baggage. There were other passengers in our position also The staff were excellent. No food except to buy not staff's fault. No TV's again not staff's fault. The seats were very comfortable.\", \"united airlines LHR-SFO-ACV.

There\\'s very little that\\'s friendly about United they have become an airline of lesser quality than the budget airlines of the world. Connecting business class flight from Auckland to San Francisco via LA. The first leg was non-stop on Air New Zealand which was excellent and connected in LA to a business class flight to SFO. When we presented our ticket at the United lounge in LA we were refused entry because it was a business class \"domestic\" flight but were offered entry as a guest of another person we had met on our flight from NZ. Sadly the lounge was a worn out mess nothing more than crackers and cheese slices in packets Internet access that was just a bit faster than the old dial up connections - nothing like any of the lounges offered by carriers we had flown elsewhere in the world. On the tired worn plane a minimal offer of chips or cookies and beverages. The worst part is that the personnel seemed tired of being caught between management decisions that have reduced the quality of service to nothing more than a poor commodity and travelers that resent the carrier.', 'united airlines Flew IAH-HNL-IAH in First Class on November 20- 24. I have flown this route several times in the last 15 years and since United took over the flying experience has taken a serious nose dive. Since this route is taken by people mostly cashing in frequent flyer miles and there are not that many \"paying\" passengers United has decided that we do not deserve the amenities that are available on other routes. The first class cabin seats are very uncomfortable and are nowhere near the first class seats of other carriers for long haul flights. The plane had no inflight entertainment and there was not any power ports for charging personal devices - and this was not just first class but the entire plane. If there was another direct flight to Hawaii from Houston on another carrier I would take it. Flying to Hawaii on Continental was a fairly good experience the food was good and the seats were comfortable even though they did not fully recline.', \"united airlines Booked flight from Newark to St Maarten months in advance - booked an aisle seat and a ctr seat together United changed our seats to a window in next to last row and a window in the last row with seats that don't recline.

I was traveling to Guatemala City from Dallas making a connection in Houston. We boarded the plane then shortly after got off due to a maintenance issue. Not once were we asked if we had a connection flight or explained to how they would help us get to our destination nor did they give us any updates. I had to ask what to do. I was supposed to be at my destination at noon. I arrived at 10.30pm. Similar incident on my return - took me all day. Bad experience.', 'united airlines PVG-LAX and IAH-LHR. Both flights were very comfortable. Seat and food is good. The only issue with the dreamliner (787) is the lack of proper window blinds. On the flight Shanghai-Los Angeles I was near the window facing south meaning that I always had the sun in front of me. Although the window transparency can be chanced it cannot be completely darkened and this is an issue when you want to sleep.', 'united airlines Flew United from LAX to IAH non-stop on an aged Boeing 737-700. The flight departed 25 minutes late for no apparent reason (no explanation given). Luggage was still being loaded 25 minutes after scheduled departure. Plenty of people that should have gate-checked luggage were wandering the plane looking for overhead bin space with no help from crew. There was no snack pay only food options. Nonetheless the crew was somewhat friendly passing frequently even offering warmed up chocolate chip cookies to some of the kids although some had to share one cookie.', \"united airlines For this 9 hour flight from Houston to Buenos Aires United uses a very old 767-300 with a 2-1-2 configuration in business class. The seats are the old Continental flat-bed seats which are angled ever-so-slightly towards the window. Although it's a flat bed the bed is very narrow and at my 190cm I could not stretch out. Felt like sleeping in a coffin! Also when you have to go to the bathroom it's quite the operation to step over your neighbour without waking them up. The service and food were OK although the plastic champagne flutes and the character-less dull white dinnerware could be improved upon.\", \"united airlines First off let me preface that I am not a frequent flyer so I tend to give airlines the benefit of the doubt if there is ever any problems. In the past 6 months I have flown two round trips with United one was non-stop and the other had 1 connecting flight. Every single one of those flights were delayed by an average of 2 hours. I would understand if there were weather conditions that cannot be foreseen but all the delays happened in Florida and California both of which had great weather. I even signed up for text alerts to get notified of these things and my alerts either came in an hour before the scheduled departure flights or never came I'm at all. That defeats the purpose of the alerts because you should to be at the airport about 2 hours prior to your flight. When I went to ask the staff at the counter at the airport they all seemed clueless and was not able to help me alleviate my concerns at all. Some were even downright rude and short with me. These inconveniences have almost cost me to be stranded at the airport because those my friends and family were not able to pick me up. I am more than furious at the less than poor customer service that United has to offer. I've spent hundreds probably even thousand of dollars to travel with this airline but I've failed to receive the proper service and professionalism from their staff and company overall. It is sad to say but I will not be flying with United Airlines anytime again soon. I would rather pay a bit more for other airlines just to ensure that I will receive the kind of service that I should be receiving as a customer.\", \"united airlines GIG-IAH-NRT.

Smooth 9 hours flight with constant info form flight deck. Surprising wide choice of IFE On time. Had to go through immigration and security in IAH. Lounge staff very pleasant. Food awful. Alcoholic beverages charged (>US1000 a glass). Fantastic shower and shower staff. Flight 2: Seat 1L. The best seat on board much more space 3 windows Silent. Same aircraft by coincidence. FA rather unpleasant and rude. Take it or leave it. Very bad food. Horrible Champagne. A nice white Bourgogne that ended after 30 min. At 11.50am lunch was completed then believe it or not no food during the next 12 hours! A tray with 2 types of frozen sandwiches was available in a corner self service. United is saving money on a 14 hour flight on food? One hour before landing greasy breakfast. Luggage quickly delivered.\", 'united airlines I may be done with United. Have had gold or platinum status for years but am getting increasingly concerned with linking flying to shopping and spending more money.

Overall I was very disappointed: food was average toilets were dirty and did not appear to have been cleaned difficult to get the staff's attention staff not willing to smile even when I was smiling at them meal service was disjointed (on one flight they offered a bread roll and some wine after I had finished my main course on the other flight they took my glass away for a refill and didn't bring it back) and the staff kept on bumping me when they walked past. The only good thing was the beds lie flat but otherwise I was very disappointed and I found that the Premium Economy on other airlines is much better (such as Qantas Virgin or Singapore).

When I first came to the airport I saw the flight would be delayed for 5-10 minutes. The flight time was originally 12.05 am but because of the delay it was supposed to depart at 12.15 am. So it was ok. But then after I board the flight does not leave until 12.40 am because they were waiting for passengers to board so obviously some passengers were late. In Air the flight crew was nice but they seemed like old United flight attendants to me. So they seemed a little cold to me. But the flight was good and I slept for 4 hours out of the 8 hours. I was glad the flight attendants gave my son the executive dining with out him asking. But the flight entertainment was ok. So it was an ok flight and it was better than the average United flight.', 'united airlines Don\\'t pay extra for business on United.

On a 6 am flight you don\\'t exactly have a chance to grab a bite before departure. There was WiFi on this flight and it had personal TVs which are better than nothing but not quite up to what we are used to with Air Canada. We barely made our connection in SFO - our bags were not so lucky. The next flight had personal TVs but no Wifi. The latter would have been really useful on the long flight. At least we finally got breakfast. The flight crew was inattentive on both flights. On the way home the long haul flight back to the mainland did not have personal TVs or overhead screens but it had WiFi! That was great for as long as my laptop battery lasted but alas the old seats had no power outlets or USBs so my joy was short-lived. Both of our seats were not capable of staying in the upright position and would slowly recline. We chose United over Air Canada as we didn\\'t want an overnight flight home. Next time we will go direct with WestJet and cram into their tiny seats in exchange for a direct flight that operates at a convenient time.

The only reason we continued to use this airline was due to the fact that EWR has the most quickest and convenient route home. Apart from that there is nothing that is appealing about the airline. The seats are not the slightest bit comfortable however you are able to slightly move them back to a tilt.

Looking at Emirates lounge in Dubai or BA lounge in London puts United at the back of the line. I did arrive in Dubai and so did my luggage but the trip was far from first class and worse still some of the original crew were on my return flight and still equally annoyed by having to perform their duties. Cabin staff are obviously disgruntled and it shows I wonder what happened to the old continental crews because before the merger continental really wasn't that bad as airlines go. Today's first class on United is not even as good as the old business first on continental.

Carrots by the truck load and processed cheese on the tiniest crackers did not appeal so we had no option but to head back out to a food retailer for a sandwich at further expense (having spent Â£6000 on tickets already for this allegedly upgraded service).

Having switched to another carrier for the last couple of years due to truly awful reliability and missing customer meetings I thought I would give UA another chance on a trip from Denver to Paris. How hard could it be? Get on the DEN-ORD flight allowing 2.5 hours in ORD to make the transfer to the ORD-CDG flight. The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight.

Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward. In summary in the future I will make a sincere effort to travel with an airline other than United.', \"united airlines 5.55am flight from Buffalo to DC then to Tampa Sunday 10/12.

I was traveling to the states for Thanksgiving weekend and was delayed 3 hours on my first flight due to \"late inbound aircraft\" and again for my connecting flight another 2 hours due to the same reason. Looking back the last 4 times I have traveled with United this has been the reason. There was no weather leaving Montreal or Chicago. Then again on my return flight I was delayed 2.5 hours and 4 hours on my connecting flight. When I finally got to my final destination at 2 am after 12 hours of traveling which should have taken a total of 6 I waited 45 minutes for my checked luggage. When I asked why we were waiting for so long the United representative told me there were two flights coming in from Chicago and they wanted to put the luggage out all at the same time. I\\'ve never heard of this happening and several other passengers and I thought this was unreasonable. Our flight landed several hours late why should we have to wait even longer for another flight to land deplane and unload their baggage. I will avoid flying with United again simply because they did nothing but say \"sorry\" and essentially ruined what would have been a very enjoyable weekend with my family.', 'united airlines Went ORD-DCA-ORD overall flights were okay although both were delayed.

Worse still the return flight was on the original aircraft which never had Economy Plus seats in the first place.

Although mainland US airlines have a bad name for treatment of their passengers - the Micronesia service transcends this. There were a number of aspects about this flight which were worrying. At Cairns the demeanour of the check-in staff was very \"in your face\" - when we asked to speak to the supervisor - this only made things worse. Documentation is a \"very touchy\" aspect of booking in for any US airline these days. Even though we had our ESTA validation application in hard copy to show they basically refused to believe we had a valid ESTA as they were having trouble accessing the data on their computer. This was even though we had our ESTA forms identical to our passports! Take a hard copy of the website baggage guidelines - they make it up as they go! When we finally got in the air - the food is poor. Be prepared for some serious security scanning in Kwajalein as it is a closed airport unless you have a sponsor or travelling to Ebeye - Passport photocopied ESTA examined separate Sponsor documentation retinal scanning height weight finger printing and questioning. If another airline elects to service this route I would certainly look to avoid UA.', \"united airlines Just completed a series of three flights back to back. The flight attendants and all other aspects of the flight were passable but with that said that's as far as it seems to go. United has gotten me back to and from in one piece but nothing from my 10 hour journey with them in a single day has been impressionable which brings me to conclude that perhaps that's all this airline is trying to achieve unlike some of its peers. Back and forth from Los Angeles to Austin I was able to get some rest and the buy on board food purchase wasn't half bad. The flight attendants on most of my flights were much younger than the usual veteran crew that I encounter on their flights therefore enthusiastic. At the end of the day United may not be my first choice but it gets me there.\", 'united airlines Oct 7 SF to Kona First Class. At the prices they charge even in this age of low expectations I was shocked at the experience of this trip. To begin with the aircraft used a 737 is just inappropriate for a five hour trip. The legroom was ridiculous for any class of service but unbelievable for a premium ticket. When the gentleman in front of me reclined his seat I had absolutely no space left. In coach one has come to expect this but not at these prices. I was one of two people judging from the upgrade list posted who paid full fare and that resulted in a full cabin. The flight attendants tried hard but United gave them nothing to work with. The breakfast served was small and awful there was only non fat milk for coffee and the food was inedible. The flight was timed to leave at 9.44 to avoid serving a more expensive lunch by one minute. The cost cutting is unbelievable the experience absolutely horrific to be avoided at any cost. Back to Hawaiian Airlines I go - the extra stop required is well worth it.', \"united airlines I flew from Manchester Airport and was flying to Newark then had a connection flight to Rochester.

After a lot of arguing they got us on the 1st flight to Newark and then found us flights on the Rochester flight but the 4 of us would not be seated together.

No idea why United still flies these ancient planes with pretty much original interior from the 80's. Chose Premium economy as it was 35h flight 79$ for this was just a scam pretty much. Got 5 extra inches leg room and that's it. Would have been nice with at least a free sandwich or whatever. Guess US carriers are still years behind European and Asian one's. Why not just call it what it is extra leg room seats? Spent 3h playing on the phone as United appears to address their customers as idiots as this was a morning flight with mostly business passengers yet still playing a cartoon movie on the overhead monitors. Talk about missing your target. Several items on the menu also ran out was sitting on row 2 so guess they just dont care to stock up on items guess what United that's another way to miss income from your passengers.

When we flew from New York to Vegas things got even worse - we had a 5-hour flight with no entertainment. If we wanted something to eat or drink they wanted paying for it and the prices were ridiculous - the free tea coffee or juice were disgusting so we stayed away from them for the entire flight. Again the crew were abysmal to say the least. We will never fly with United again.

Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.', 'united airlines Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done. After a lot of talking we got onto our originally scheduled flight and got home on schedule.', \"united airlines On a recent trip we flew 3 times with United. The first flight was on 9 September and we flew from Vancouver to Denver with a stopover en route to Albuquerque. These seats were all booked by a travel agent and confirmed 5 months prior to travel. On the first flight my husband and I were seated separately - I was seated behind my husband. We were given water and/or soft drink during the flight. The attendants were very brisk and almost rude in the 'service' they offered. But the flight did leave and arrive on time. The connecting flight however was not such a straight forward experience. When we went to the check-in we were informed by the staff that the flight had been over booked and that we at that stage were the over booked people. They did not apologise in fact they treated us very rudely. They spent the next hour and a half offering 2 passengers other flights hotel accommodation and $500 flight vouchers each in an effort to allow us to board the flight. Eventually and approximately 3 mins before the flight doors were to close after boarding and after I stood at the counter for around 10 mins they informed me that we could board. Again we were seated separately with my husband at the back of the plane and me sitting at the front. Never any apology. Our third flight was on the 13 September and we flew from Albuquerque to LAX in readiness for our flight back to Auckland NZ. The staff at the airport were again rude. Our flight left more or less on time and the flight staff were great bright and friendly. They actually appeared to be enjoying their job and treated the passengers with friendliness and courtesy.

Food was barely edible for dinner but it got better for breakfast and drinks were forthcoming. Legroom was okay. From the US leg I had to use the kiosk to check in but it refused to print my ticket and required a staff to assist me.

It wasn't until we were almost to Denver that they bothered to inform us of the added time to the flight and we arrived just in time to see our next plane depart. They did put us up in a hotel for free and got us on the next flight out the next morning only to have that plane stop mid-takeoff due to a plane malfunction.

If you are going to force your passengers to use your WiFi please offer a superior solution than what currently exists or just use GoGo or another service that already does a great job. Why was I not notified that this brand new plane would not have TVs? I expected to have TVs in a brand new plane.

Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer. I am confident that I will continue to be. There are some lovely people in the friendly skies!\", \"united airlines UA635 LAS to LA 15 Sept 2014. UA 306 LAX to BWI 15 Sept. The worst thing that has happened is United merging with Continental. Having been a million mile flyer on Continental I find the flight schedules on United a total mess. Always a hub connection whether it's Chicago Denver Houston Cleveland LA or San Francisco always inconvenient and time consuming. Boarding process is archaic Southwest can unload reload and leave in the time it takes United Passengers to Board. Always delays and excuses. Give me Southwest any day no Mickey Mouse seat charges baggage charges have a decent amount of non stop flights plus at least you get peanuts more than I can say I get from United's unhappy flight attendants.\", 'united airlines Very dissatisfied! Today I had a flight from Charleston to Phoenix with a one hour lay over in Houston. Very little time to switch terminals but scheduled by United. While waiting I learned the Charleston flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Told by flight attendant that this is due to one crew member coming late to the flight causing the delay. Now I have 30 min to get to flight which will not happen and have to stay night in Houston. United has reserved flight at 07.30 next morning. Problem: Parking has been prepaid on my vehicle only until my arrival time. My luggage is already in Phoenix as it left on earlier flight. No reservations in Houston for stay. No meal arrangements. I will refuse to travel with United in the future. Just a note. United has offered meal vouchers and hotel.', 'united airlines Travel agent persuaded me to buy economy plus seat tickets at Â£960 per person for travel on 22nd August 2014.

As usual the leg room felt the same as cheap economy seat the space between two aisle seats was the same. Trolley kept hitting passengers. The food was of poor quality on both legs.

Never have I flown another airline with this kind of awful service small airplanes and old smelly seats pretty uncomfortable for business class. Rude attendants was quite bossy boarding is odd you have a business boarding pass and start wondering how many people fit in that section of the plane before they allow you to board. I have a feeling they inherited the bad service from Continental. One thing is sure no one in his right mind after flying any European Asian or Latin American airline like me will surely never set foot on United's planes again.\", \"united airlines As a Platinum customer I fly a lot with United and it is amazing how bad United has become over the last 5 years. Not only did they delay today's departure for a little bit of rain in DC and called it a thunderstorm but they also let our connection leave without us for our honeymoon. I am less frustrated when it is a business trip as I always expect that United does not make its connections. Last year I did not have a single flight on time and missed 6 flights. The business class had very uncomfortable seats the staff made the same announcement every 20 minutes for about 2 hours that we would be a little bit late. Then they made another announcement that someone would be waiting with information for us in Munich. All we were told at Munich airport was to go to the Lufthansa Service Center. The service agent sen us immediately to the departure gate but did not let the airplane know that there were multiple customers coming. So the plane left 5 minutes before we arrived at the gate after a wild goose chase through Munich airport. After flying for years and being vegetarian I usually bring my own food as I am over the monotonous and tasteless food they serve but today I flew business and I wanted some champagne and a meal. It is always the same and the quality of the food has gone downhill and the dessert has also not changed in the last 5 years. The purser came and apologized in person big deal however she did not have any information for those that got stranded in Munich.What about their new security video between images with kangaroos and people sitting in seats on the beach you get completely lost in their new bizarre security video. As an educator I can guarantee that not 1/3 of people have afterwards a clue of what was said because this looks more like a reality TV series or a bad infomercial. I have been to Africa Peru and Europe on three long flights and the movies between these directions do not change. In the last 6 weeks I have seen almost all of what is worth seeing so that's why I gave the Entertainment 1 star.

When I got to the airport I was advised the flight had been cancelled earlier that day. The ticketing agent said there were no available flights so I was stranded in Indianapolis until the next morning. She was unwilling to offer any hotel or any other compensation. The only available flights the next day had layovers instead of being direct. I took a United flight easily from IND to ORD the next morning. However the flight from ORD to IAD on UA382 was horrible. We boarded the flight late because there were so many people on standby. Then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours because they said they needed to refuel. Supposed to land at 11:39am but arrived after 1.30 pm.', 'united airlines On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible. Altogether not a very good experience.', 'united airlines Had a very bad experience with United Airlines. While travelling from EWR to MSP we boarded the aircraft and were kept sitting for 1 hour then we were told that there were some technical issues so we changed aircraft. Second aircraft also made us wait for one and half hours due to a fuelling issue. Coming back from MSP to EWR the flight was delayed an hour. I will never fly again with United.', \"united airlines After two years of planning I thought I had all my ducks in a row for a trip from the USA to the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane. I even hired a Travel Agency to avoid any mistakes on my part. Boy was I mistaken. August 25 2014 was finally here. I went to my local airport two hours early (as instructed) and sat there for six hours at the United Airlines boarding gate. We were told the four hour delay was due to the weather in Chicago. Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable. The rude United employees are unacceptable.\", 'united airlines UA5260 IAH-LIT.

They have consistently delayed flights to/from MRY because they cannot find a plane. On September 3rd they changed gates twice making it difficult for a senior to get to. Today September 10th they are delaying again for the same reason. This means that I'll miss my LA connection because this flight will arrive after the plane leaves that airport.

United is the only commercial airline flying into ACV. Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.\", \"united airlines I took a flight from Shanghai to SFO and onward to LAS. On the return trip from LAS to SFO and then to Hong Kong. 1) Old planes - the planes are so old you don't even get your own personal TV.

How is anyone near those screens ever going to sleep on the long flights? 2) Food just is bad. You need to pay for alcoholic drinks. Really? You can't price that into the ticket? 3) Check in at LAS is a nightmare. The auto check-in machines don't really work and require a lot of manual intervention from the staff but there's probably 2 staff serving about 2 dozen machines. 4) Seats are bad.\", 'united airlines If I could give United Airlines 0 stars I would. United is a horrible airline with awful customer service unreliable departures dirty airplanes and rude stewards. I booked my ticket 6 months in advance and was bumped to a different later flight about a month prior to my trip. I called the airline and was able to be placed on my original flight. The customer service representative offered no sensical explanation as to why I got bumped. I wanted to ensure I would not be charged for their mistake. The representative assured me I would not be. Well that was not the case. On the day of my flight I found out I had double reservations for two different flights and was charged twice. I immediately called customer service to rectify the situation. I was on the phone for over an hour and the situation was handled horribly. I am beyond disappointed and disgusted with their lack of professionalism.

I booked a trip to Las Vegas and the flight was delayed. United re-routed my flight through Delta.

The flights themselves were ok but everything costs extra now.\", \"united airlines After flying from Sacramento to Dulles airport in Washington and then on to Frankfurt it was apparent why United ranks at or near the bottom in the airline ratings. The Airbus 320 to Washington a 5+ Hour flight was brutal. There is no leg room at all the seats are flimsy and uncomfortable and it's impossible to recline your seat because of cramped space. It should be unlawful to pack that many people into limited space. The flight attendants were tired surly and unfriendly. We were in Economy but a row of seats right in front of us were Economy Plus they were empty on our flight. My husband needed to use the bathroom so I sat down in one of the Economy Plus seats until he finished so I could stretch my legs. An FA quickly came over and informed me I couldn't sit there. I told her I was waiting for my husband etc. She said rudely that I needed to return to my assigned seat. There were many empty seats on this flight but when people tried to spread out to get more room they were told no. One man asked if he could sit in one of those seats and was told no because they were Economy Plus. I don't get this attitude. The food was horrendous! There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight. Aegean Air from Istanbul to Frankfurt a 55 minute flight served a hot meal - at midnight! There's something wrong with this picture. On the Washington to Frankfurt flight we were served something called a crostini. It had processed lunch meat and processed cheese. It was so horrible I couldn't eat it. Airline food has never been great but it's reached a new low. United should be ashamed of their service. We won't fly with them again.\", 'united airlines I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). \"Can you please wait\" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger\\'s seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you\\'ll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you\\'ll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because \"we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice\". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get. Do note that the ratings were made when comparing against the inflight experience I had when I took Cathay Pacific and ANA flights from Singapore to SF earlier this year and last year.', \"united airlines Not great.

Copa can do nothing with a 'United booking' so called United in USA to find out. Flight had been cancelled although no email received.

As well as the staff being incredibly surly I was amazed that they chose to serve a chicken dinner at 10.30am in the morning! They can't even use the rationale that they were working on the destination time zone as we were flying to the US and it would have been 3am there!

Maybe never.\", \"united airlines Unless you want to have hours of intimate contact with a stranger do not fly United! I am a small women in my 60's. United's seat size just fits me. I was in a window seat when a medium-large gentleman a little round around the edges sat next to me. This man was not obese. He overflowed his seat enough that every time he moved we were shuffled together from butt to knee. I put up with it for half an hour and then excused myself to the aisle. I paced in the back of the plane for an hour. The attendants were serving whatever they serve and saw that I was near hysteria at the thought of returning to what awaited me in my assigned seat. They did find a solution eventually. A United employee was flying coach and they switched me out with him. But the new seat was only 3 rows in front of the gentleman who had been next to me and he had to watch this seat change knowing his size overlapping mine was the cause. These conditions are set up by United in planning an aircraft with seats that are way smaller than the human population of these times. They know this and leave it to their flight attendants to deal. Other airline carriers are tight too but I have heard and witnessed that United is the worst.\", 'united airlines We were on a trip from Newark to San Diego. The nightmare began when we noticed that we (as two friends travelling together) had been assigned seats that were not located next to each other. But we were okay with this. The flight attendants were pretty friendly but drinks were only served 2 times and food was not served at all (on a 5.5 hours flight). There was the option to purchase food but in my opinion it should go without saying that complementary food is offered on a long-distance flight. Onboard entertainment was also not available for free. Furthermore the TV screens could not be turned off so we were exposed to continuing advertising which lasted the whole flight. When we finally reached our destination in San Diego we were tired starving and thirsty.', \"united airlines My wife and I booked a flight through last minute.com it was really a last minute thing because we had to be in Auburn by the 22nd August 2014. We got a flight for the 21st August which involved a couple of stops. The flight was from Birmingham UK stopping at Newark NJ and then at Washington Dulles then Syracuse (outgoing). First the flight was supposed to leave Birmingham at 09.00hrs that left 3 hrs late due to technical trouble. Got to Newark NJ so late we missed the 14.50 connection to Washington Dulles. They then booked us on another flight from Newark to Syracuse that was leaving at 21.04hrs that never turned up until about 22.30 and because there was a little downpour of rain the flight was delayed it had never left Attica. We went out on to the tarmac to board the plane and was confronted with a plane that looked like something from the Fred Flinstone era. This was a tiny DHC8 turbo prop plane and we were buffeted around like a roller coaster. So for that trip we were delayed for about 12 hours. Not even a cup of tea or a glass of water was offered to the passengers. The way back was even worse we were supposed to leave Syracuse at 19.10hrs on the 2nd September 2014. Next thing you know the rain started to fall again flight cancelled for 24 hours. We had to spend our own money for a one night stay in a hotel. So instead of going from Syracuse to Washington to Brussels to Birmingham we now had to go from Syracuse to Washington to Dublin then Birmingham.

Boarded an almost new plane that was in pristine condition comfortable seats (travelling on miles and paid for upgrade to premium seating). Ready for a great flight left on time. The flight crew were terrible there were glares from the front of the plane to the back. Almost no eye contact with customers rude finger pointing. When the snack trolley came by they simply walked past directed their comments to the air in front of them and continued on - likely very few sales there! When coffee and drinks came by they were already past before we could even request a drink (we weren't really asked you see) and we had to call them back to get a coffee. When I went to the toilet the crew simply jerked their finger at me without saying anything and gestured me into a seat that was vacant to wait. They scowled at everyone. By the time we left the plane the people in the seats behind me across from me and the seats near the toilets (I heard them talking as well) were totally turned off by our crew. This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it. It was wrong in that they do need to collect their luggage to go through customs. Fortunately customs officials were asking people to make sure they had their forwarded luggage. Terrible service. I was flying on miles so the value was great the plane was new and comfortable the experience the pits!\", \"united airlines YWG-ORD-YWG: Got to the airport in plenty of time check in on United App didn't work for me so had to use the kiosk and have by far the United kiosks take the longest to fill out. Line up through security was long and slow due to only one lane being open (obviously not United's fault but still frustrating). United flight to and from Winnipeg are seldom on time and either delayed or cancelled probably about 70% of the time. It was no surprise to me that it was delayed an hour and a half. Ended up landing in Chicago about 2 hours late. On the way home mobile check in worked and the whole experience was positive. Got to the gate and seeing my flight was on time was too good to be true and it was. It moved gates and was delayed 40 minutes. Both flights were on an E145.

We purchased Economy tickets from NRT-IAH-FLL-SCE-IAD-NRT but I later upgraded to BusinessFirst with cash. The cash upgrade cost $1400 each. On the NRT-IAH leg the first thing that I found odd was that the FA literally threw the tablecloth to/at me at the beginning of dinner service. I think he just didn't care because throughout the flight his demeanor was cold. Small things like my wife's request for water without ice were met with the glass of water with the biggest piece of ice in it. The seat was great the food was about what you'd expect at a family restaurant and I'm ok with both of these things but I really had to wonder don't people who pay to fly premium deserve at least not passive-aggressiveâ€\\x9dservice? I guess not. The NRT- IAH departure was an hour late due to weather. We were not able to make our connection at IAH. I bet United Airlines could have helped expedite passengers (through immigration/customs/re-checking) with tight connections. Our IAH-FLL departed while we were waiting for our bags. I informed the UA rep at the baggage claim and he told me they'd rebooked us on the next mornings 06.40 IAH-FLL. I asked if I could get a meal/hotel voucher but he informed me that since it was a weather delay UA couldn't take care of us. We feared that we might oversleep the 06.40 flight because of the jetlag. I called UA to ask for another booking and though there were 4 IAH-FLL flights that day our only options were 06.40 or 20.00 departure. Their website revealed open seats on all flights but the rep explained to me that those were first class seats and we weren't eligible for them. The weather delay on departure was caused by a typhoon. IAH is also known to be quite poor at handling international flights. UA made the decision to sell NRT-IAH tickets with a 1.5-hour buffer nonetheless. Maybe it's my fault for buying it but at any rate rather than stay up all night or lose yet another day with my family we accepted a better-timed flight to MIA. Our business with UA resumed two weeks later for the SCE-IAD-NRT return to Japan we took another carrier for our FLL-MBJ and MBJ-ATL-DTW-SCE trips. I mistakenly placed a bottle of honey in my carry-on which was picked up by TSA at security. I figured that if I couldn't get to my bags I could box and check it. I saw my bags were already gone so I waited at the side of the check-in line and figured I would wait until they announced last call for SCE-IAD. The desk rep soon did so and I politely explained â€œI'd like to get this in to my checked bags.â€\\x9d The man was the portrait of hypertension and stress.

Eventually another rep nicely asked me to go get a box from the store across the hallway and I did and when I came back the stressed-out rep acquiesced and while printing the tape/tags repeated over and over â€œ The flights boarding/you've got to get on it/itâ€™s leaving.â€\\x9dThe flight was just starting to board.

The staff were very unwelcoming. My seat was behind the exit row which was empty - all the row was empty and seeing as I was sitting between a family who had been split up because of the shoddy seating arrangements we asked if we were able to use the exit row. The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to \"seal off the section\" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - \"well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea\". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol. Don\\'t get me wrong I can go with out a drink for 16 hours but its a small touch to offer an alcoholic beverage as part of the service.

Not just baggage but tons of commercial boxes. Our plane which was originally supposed to take off at 5pm for Houston did not take off until almost 7pm which put us in Houston at 9.30 a half hour after our plane left for Portland. That was just the beginning of our frustration. As I got to the gate and went to ask the United Airline attendant about connections she said \"see the guy down there and he will help you with connecting flight.\" She was just telling us what we needed to hear to get us out of her way. By the time I got to customer service at 9.45 United Airlines customer service workers were dropping like flies among a mob of very unhappy people. We are talking 10pm people at one of America\\'s busiest airports. 10.30 I finally get with a customer service worker who gets me food voucher\\'s taxi voucher\\'s and a hotel voucher for a best western 25 minutes away from the airport. She said \"grab some food around the corner\". All food venues were closed. We walked down to ground transportation and were informed only yellow cabs accept taxi voucher\\'s. Finally got a cab and made it to the hotel at 11.30. In short lies and terrible customer service. The cargo was more important than the passengers and the customer service was horrible.

The TPA-ORD leg was the usual 'bus' service you get used to for US domestic trips but the international leg was beyond terrible. The aircraft was old - decor of a bygone era. The TV screens were the sort I remember for a decade ago - tiny no personal controls. The food was stingy and poor quality (a slab of meat resembling a chicken breast at some time in the past). The cabin crew were surly and long past retirement age (who knows what would happen in an emergency).

But if you fly stand by you get to set in premium seats with better group number getting a better chance to have overhead space because no one wants to pay $84 just to sit closer to the front of the plane which gives you a better group number. Other airlines are based on more you pay more you get. Was already paying max for flight way more than rest because time constraints than other passengers.

The food was better than I expected it to be. They served so many appetizers before the main course that I was full. I was so surprised when they asked if I would like ice cream and customized it with toppings right in front of me!

The seats were really comfortable as they had the option to put them 180 degrees so that you can sleep (the armrests automatically go down as the bed reclines) and can sleep comfortably for a tall person. They also had plenty of plugs that accepts USA and other countries plugs. The seats have plenty of storage however found it odd that flight attendants won't allow you to stow things under your seat.

I was flying from Houston Texas to LAX. There was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about 2 hours. I understand there are natural disasters out of the airlines control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they could use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate peoples needs. Once we were in the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out! That was pretty much my only option. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn\\'t work. So we waited once again to be let out. Finally it was time to go get my luggage which was taken from me in Texas because there was no more room for my bag. I was the last one on the flight because they had a computer glitch and they couldn\\'t find my seat. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the problem. They didn\\'t tell me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once I arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seem to be many other problems last night. Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told to go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane! It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another Inited employee where I could get my luggage and again with an attitude she said \"Obviously it\\'s right there can\\'t you see it?\". I told her their screens are broken so no I can\\'t see it. Most United Airline employees are rude disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job. Unfortunately this is the 2nd time I have such a horrible experience with United.', 'united airlines I was flying recently from Lincoln NE to Chicago IL. This flight goes back and forth between the two cities multiple times per day. The Lincoln airport also houses Delta and only has four gates so it is very small. The first flight left Lincoln and made it to Chicago with no problems. As the flight was coming back to Lincoln from Chicago it was diverted to Kansas City MO in which the staff members told us that it is too \"foggy\" to land in Lincoln. What was upsetting was that our flight was delayed three hours and there was not any fog in the area. In fact there was partial sunshine the day of our flight. The staff did not even apologize or attempt to assist the customers who had connecting flights in Chicago. Once on the aircraft the flight attendant was very rude and demeaning. For example we were at the back of the airplane and we did not even receive a beverage before we landed in which the flight attendant told us that we did not need one because she ran out of time.', \"united airlines Calgary Airport to Houston (George Bush) on 31st July 2014.

The lady we spoke to in Chicago simply said \"you had a short layover and in cases like that we don\\'t get the luggage because its too difficult.\" Once we were in Chicago and realized our baggage hadn\\'t made it onto our plane we were told that it would be very easy to give the UA baggage office our address and they would ship them to us the next day. So we landed in Calgary (an hour late) and went to the UA baggage office to report our missing bags and give our address to them. We waited at their office for 1.5 hrs. This was a very frustrating experience in regards to the baggage and customer service. On a final note I would not recommend traveling with United Airlines (Lufthansa)!', 'united airlines Flew Houston-Denver in Economy Plus. UAL charges you extra for deplorable seats. So narrow that the normal sized guy next to me was half in my seat. And the so called extra leg room is a scant 3 inches more for $50. The guy in front reclined his seat all the way ans I thought I was in a tiny cage. UAL charges for AV service. The snack pack for $8 was just OK. The flight staff was friendly - the only positive about this airline.', \"united airlines United Airlines business or first class to Aruba is very bad. Misleading advertising service and claimed equipment is false. No inflight entertainment as advertised. No video or music in First Class. Seats tray and pockets all dirty with food and garbage from last passenger. This was a brand new plane and in first class the seats were so close I could not get out of my seat without disturbing the passenger in front of me or to my side. Food was spoiled with rancid oil used. Staff could care less. Not even power for my laptop to get work done. Wi-Fi entertainment power all advertised and paid for but got none of it.

I know flying United is sometimes cheaper but its not even worth it.', 'united airlines I flew 3 times with UA during our July 2014 vacations: a round trip Houston-Managua and Houston-Munich. 1) Houston-Managua-Houston: a 3 hour trip and neither a packet of peanuts nor a coke to offer. All was chargeable but water. Never experienced it before with a major airline. 2) Houston-Munich: Firstly our initial flight was cancelled after a 4 hours wait. Ground staff overwhelmed. We waited 2 hours more for rebooking on next day flight they lodged us for overnight in a poor hotel. When finally we took the next days flight crew on board were unpleasant neither a smile nor a \"thank you\" especially for the offloaded passenger of the previous day. Lunch and breakfast were unacceptable except for pets. Frankly I\\'m not a demanding guy nor a pain but I will never take this airline anymore.', 'united airlines I booked a straight flight from Washington Dulles to Toronto CA. Keep in mind that this was a weekend trip and I was supposed to return Monday afternoon. My departing flight was scheduled for 3.20pm and we boarded around 4pm. The pilot announced that the door could not close completely so we had to wait for an Engineer to fix it. We waited on the plane for an hour. The Engineer came and it took an additional 30 minutes. We got on the runway then the pilot announced that Toronto had issued a no-fly restriction due to severe thunderstorms. We waited on the runway for an hour. They took us back to the terminal and after about 2 0minutes it was time to take off again. We got back on the runway went to the same spot to prepare for take-off when the pilot announced that Toronto Intl. issued another no-fly restriction and we had to wait 30 more minutes. So we did. Then later they called the plane off the runway and cancelled the flight. It took 2 hours to get to customer service so they could help me get on another flight. The Agents were so rude and barely attempted to help me find something that would take me to Toronto that night! Ended up booking me on a 5.45am flight Saturday morning. I left Washington Airport at 11pm. Saturday morning I got on a connecting flight through Texas. What was supposed to be a straight flight to Toronto took 6 hours! To make matters worse my new booking was out of Reagan Airport so I had to adjust my return flight. They gave me a flight back on Air Canada (the Toronto to Chicago leg). I stood in line to check in and learned from the agent at Air Canada that United never officially reserved the seat for me. I had to run to United get them to reserve the flight give me a print out so that I could return to Air Canada. I connected in Chicago. The United flight from Chicago to DC was hour late. I lost time money and sleep. United had no compassion and was unapologetic.', 'united airlines After taking a red-eye from San Francisco I was bumped from my flight. It happens the planes were switched but the very blatant tension selection of those who got left behind was very frustrating. The customers left behind had booked their flight well in advance and there seemed to be a consistent trait we were connectors from SF. The question of whether I was in for an adventure aka a delayed flight to a completely different location was condescending. No apology until I dealt with a woman at the end of the process. She treated the situation with sensitivity and realized that as a traveler and customer this could possibly be stressful and frustrating. As their customer it seemed like my Sunday was worth less than everyone on the plane. Perhaps they should under board planes not over board them to make more money.', \"united airlines Completely disorganized unfriendly and the least bit helpful. The customer service from the second I came into the airport in Toronto were so unwelcoming. After printing out my boarding passes at the kiosk with no help (Sunwing kiosks had assistants walking around assisting people) struggled with a kiosk and then headed to the line to check bags in. The girl at the desk just seemed so unimpressed and was very cold towards my family and I. Upon going through customs it was very disorganized and very little help was offered while at the receipt kiosks. While going through baggage check the man checking our carry ons was telling everyone that passed that our flight was cancelled. Mind you the smartphone app said the flight was on time early actually. We then got into the waiting area there was just a sense of panic going on and nobody knew what was going on. A flight attendant came and confirmed it was cancelled. Maybe 10 minutes went by and another flight attendant came by and said it was in fact running on time and not to worry. All in all very disorganized and unwelcoming. I've always flown with Sunwing and I guess next time I won't be travelling with United.\", 'united airlines I have had several problems with UA over the years and tend to avoid them but recently I had no good option other than to travel with them from SFO to Dulles round-trip in economy class. The return flight on a 757-300 was horrific with turbulence for hours. The pilot never really commented on it other than a brief \"It\\'s bumpy so I\\'ve turned on the seat belt sign\". I am only 5\\' 2\" and 105 lbs. and I was unable to sit without my knees hitting the seat in front of me. There was no in-flight entertainment at all. I will continue to avoid flying UA at all costs even though they have a hub near us in SFO. My past grievance with them concerned their small seats rude flight staff and last-minute flight cancellations back-to-back with other overbooked flights. While turbulence is turbulence it was handled very poorly.', 'united airlines UA982 12/23/2013. United provided me with the worst traveling experience of my life. I spent 24 hours in Kuwait City airport after a cancelled flight. United gave me the run-around promising flight after flight which were all already overbooked. The only compensation I received was a complimentary hotel room. I got to the hotel at 1.30am and they took me back to the airport at 4am to catch a flight that was of course overbooked. I finally got a flight (on a different airline) 12 hours later. I understand that some circumstances simply cannot be helped. That is the gamble that goes along with travel. It is the being lied to and treated so poorly which made my experience so terrible.', \"united airlines I write this review sitting in the Milwaukee Wisconsin airport. My flight from Milwaukee to Chicago has been first cancelled then delayed twice. I should have driven to Chicago. Missed two connecting flights. Should have bee in Hartford CT at 10am then 2pm now 4pm. What an absolute joke. When an airline can't provide adequate service from Milwaukee to Chicago they should just fold up their tent and go home. Don't pretend to be a transportation service when you can't transport people as promised. Scheduled this trip specifically to attend a theatre production produced by a friend. Attending that event despite my best planning is being placed in jeopardy by this airline.\", 'united airlines The worst airlines I have flown in years! Kiosks were confusing and not enough help to use them. Both round trip flights from Boston to San Francisco were packed to the gills. Seats were terrible and cramped and it felt like you were sardines. Absolutely no snacks at all! Food offerings looked so bad even the staff said not to buy most of them. They have the audacity on the flight back to charge passengers for direct TV with no free channels at all! No cool circulating air so it felt suffocating! Seats terrible and uncomfortable. Staff agreed with our complaints. Flight was one hour late getting into Boston.', \"united airlines HKG-SFO July 28 2014 Economy Plus. Quite simply the worst over-pacific flight I've had (I've had about 70+). The United International Economy Plus product is quite simply one of the worst available when aboard a crusty old 747. The IFE was antiquated and the movies were b-movies at best. The plane is old and crusty and desperately in need of an update. Flight attendants were indifferent and nearly tossed meal trays onto your fold down tray. Seats were dilapidated. Flight took off and landed late. This United international product is sub-standard and should be an embarrassment to United Airlines. With Star Alliance partners ANA and Asiana both offering superior product at same price why would anyone fly United? Quite simply the other airlines do a better job on these routes.\", \"united airlines LHR-ORD-LHR. Initial impressions of United were not great as I attempted to check in online only to find that their website system 'could not check you in at this time' after going through the whole process! United now operate from the new terminal 2 at Heathrow which is a big improvement. However upon boarding it was noticeable that the 767 was quite old (pre Boeing 'signature interior' and my seat was uncomfortable. The IFE system is also outdated and was unreliable. However the flight was punctual. The check in system for my return flight ORD-LHR was poor. Initial check in at the airport required using an automated terminal but I could not select a seat as these are allocated at the gate. It is then necessary to queue again to be allocated a seat. There is also not enough space in the departure area to accommodate everyone travelling on the flight. The onboard conditions were also similar on the return flight to the outbound (same aircraft type) except that I was bumped down into the standard economy section from the Economy Plus section. As someone who is 6ft plus this meant squeezing into a cramped seat with minimal legroom - totally unsuitable for a lengthy flight. In addition they ran out of meal choices so passengers had to 'get what they are given'. United also have a stingy policy of charging for alcoholic drinks at inflated prices. Once again the seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not even working this time. Thankfully arrival was slightly early and the arrival process at Heathrow was most efficient. I will try to avoid flying with United again until they improve the quality of their product.\", 'united airlines HNL-ORD. Overnight in a B777-200. United is refurbishing these aircrafts-and we wished they would hurry it up! No sound A/V Wi-Fi. No entertainment whatsoever (but at least no one had worked the Sudoku in my \"Hemispheres\" mag.). My seat worked ok but my wife had to manually lift the leg support on hers and couldn\\'t unhinge the foot rest. Then in addition the reading light for her seat wouldn\\'t turn off. On-board staff were great: sincerely apologetic for the lack of amenities profusely sympathetic about the seat problems. Service was excellent. Dinner was very good breakfast less so but still appreciated. This could be a very good trip once the planes are fixed up.', \"united airlines I boarded UAL 771 July 25th SFO to LAX. I had an International flight to catch on another airline. While I have had my share of grumpy UAL flight attendants I immediately noticed a different energy in the FC cabin when I entered (I bought FC - it was not a complimentary upgrade). There were two male flight attendants being warm and welcoming. They were constantly seeing what passengers needed (it was a 24 seat 757). They knew how to handle every request and not just with a sterile perfunctory smile. The mood among all of the passengers was noticeably different. I'm not sure that many of UAL's FA's know how significant they are in creating an energy on the plane among the people by the way they welcome and serve the passengers. Most FA's know how to serve a cup of water. That does not take much skill. However to serve the water and give the sense that it is done graciously is something else.\", 'united airlines Flight from ORD to Edinburgh was first delayed and then cancelled at 7pm due to \"aircraft maintenance\". We were told to stay at the gate where a \\'recover\\' team would rebook us onto other flights. It took each agent about 15 minutes to deal with each customer and then after standing in line for an hour we were told that we had to leave the gate as it was needed for another flight. We were told to go and join the back of the long queue at the Customer Services desk across the hall. After standing in line for almost another hour we were told that the best that could be done would be to put us on the flight the next day. Luckily I checked and found an American Airlines flight to London Heathrow leaving at 9.40pm that night with an onward connection to Edinburgh with British Airways.

When breakfast service came they had cereal and fruit. That\\'s the meal for a $3000 ticket. The attendant repeatedly told me \"That is all we currently have available\". I offered to buy my own breakfast from the coach menu and was informed that I would indeed have to purchase my meal. On my return flight scheduled at 2.30 pm from Dulles the flight was delayed twice then cancelled at 6pm. Provided with a $100 coupon - certainly doesn\\'t pay for a hotel room in DC. My original plan - flying back on the 10.10 pm flight indeed proved irrational. It was also delayed. I asked the customer service agent to put me on American 6.15 flight to LA. She refused pointing out that I was on backup for 10.10 pm with United. She reissued my ticket on American at the coach rate. She also incorrectly copied down the gate to delay my progress. Thankfully they were on the same concourse. When I made it to American I indeed confirmed that there still was an open first class ticket. The lovely American agent called United and unfortunately did no better than I had for the past three hours finding someone who could reissue the ticket as first class. American graciously put me in the last seat without any help and much hindrance from United. I can honestly say that one should strongly consider their well being before booking a United flight.', \"united airlines Went ORD-DCA-ORD to visit family.

It's time for the United brand to retire.\", 'united airlines I booked a \"direct\" flight from Berlin Germany to Newark NJ USA and instead of being direct once we got to the airport we were told the airplane would be stopping to fuel up in Maine (obviously not for our flight but for the one after ours). Furthermore having made this trip from Germany/USA several times with other various airlines in comparison United has old planes and less amenities. Lastly there was no way to request a special meal from their website I looked and looked but the meal option was continually grayed out and ended up having to call customer service - another inconvenience.', \"united airlines We scheduled a flight from Dayton OH. to Boston with a connection going to Boston in Newark and another connection flying back with a connection in Chicago. Not once did we depart on-time. Newark was a disaster. We had our flight cancelled obtained a second flight but the customer service rep never suggested we try to get an earlier standby flight. Nobody called us from standby until I questioned the boarding attendant minutes prior to takeoff but managed to get onto the plane only to sit on the runway for over an hour because of a backup radio malfunction which ultimately caused the flight to be cancelled. After 7 hours we made it to Boston. Going home we arrived in Chicago and again on United's commuter connection we had another 2 hour wait while something on the plane was fixed. Service was poor especially in Newark where there were two hundred people waiting at customer service to rebook and two reps staffing the computers talking on a phone and letting a plane load of customers wait. Bottom line is that I almost could have driven to Boston from my home in Ohio and not lost much time.\", 'united airlines I am appalled with the way I was treated by this airline. My connecting flight was canceled and no other accommodations were made for an entire flight. When I was told that I would have to stay at the airport for 10 hours for the next available seat my only option was driving to my final destination. The staff had no answers to my questions. When I went to get my baggage I was told it would be about 2 hours before my 1 suitcase would be brought to the carousel. The woman at baggage claim did not follow through and my suitcase was sent to another airport. I had to drive to get my bag from the other airport. I received nothing but frustration for all of the airlines mistakes. Terrible start to my vacation and I will never book with United again.', 'united airlines I flew out of LAX at 6 am July 9 2014. The flight took off at its scheduled time. The only complaint I had concerning this flight is it makes no sense to me for the airline to load the front of the plane first. It would be more efficient and there would be far less congestion in the front of the aircraft. For the flight from LAX the ground staff were very sloppy and inattentive. United has rules concerning the size allowed for carry-ons. Many passengers were allowed to bring full-size suitcases on board and of course the overhead bins rapidly filled up. I was pleased to see the staff at Dulles for my return flight were enforcing the rules and numerous passengers had to check over sized carry-ons. Charging an extra $25 for the first checked bag will preclude my flying United in the future.', 'united airlines I flew with United for the first time back in June/July flying non-stop on the new service between Edinburgh and Chicago and on to Wausau. I was surprisingly impressed with everything the check-in was fine there was no delays and the \"Premium Access\" (speedy boarding) was worth it. The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot). Think it was chicken and something pretty good by economy standards. The seat was comfortable and obviously for the person in front of me to as she decided to recline her seat for the whole flight but I guess the fact of a spare seat beside me overcame the fact. I was slightly nervous about having to navigate Chicago as after reading reviews I thought it was going to be awfully daunting but everything was quick like seriously only 10 mins in the immigration line extremely impressed with that. Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus.

For my $13000 r-t ticket I got the narrowest business class seat I've ever been in. They squeeze 8 across in their 777s including 4 abreast in the center aisle. Basically an unfriendly cabin staff that showed little initiative in anticipating customer needs and were inflexible and downright rude in enforcing cabin protocol (use of first class rest rooms when business class facilities were wait listed even though the only people in first class were the second pilot and co-pilot).

The appetizer had unidentifiable meat on it that was so leathery I couldn't even chew it. The roll was as hard as a rock. The toddler in a seat near me made a lot of noise.

I arrived in San Francisco and there is a four hour delay on my flight to Boston due to an engine failure on the plane originating in Washington D.C.

They kept intermittently announcing that the flight would take off now and then and so on. But eventually 6 hours after we first boarded the plane the flight was cancelled.

I decided to check- in for this flight as I would have to get up at 5am to catch it. At 7pm when I went to check in online I found out that my flight had again been cancelled (couldn't blame the weather - reason given was no crew) and I was re- scheduled for a flight at 1.30pm. There was no email sent to me nor was I contacted to be informed of this change less than 10 hours before my flight. When my flight 5876 was cancelled on 3 Jul 14 there were 2 staff members to re-schedule over 50 people - it takes about 45 minutes for the staff to re-schedule each person. How come United could not find more staff - this was known there would be cancellations predictable that flights would be cancelled. Overall a pretty shabby performance from United. Now again today they cancelled my flight - also did not inform me at all - I found out by accident by looking at their website. This was the only flight cancelled going to Harrisburg PA.

Bottom line they kept me in a small airport from almost 9am until 9pm and then no flight. I've heard similar problems with this airline. Seems the service offered by this airline has declined tremendously since the merger (Continental + United). Very unreliable and I definitely try to avoid using this airline at least until there is significant improvement in service.\", 'united airlines I flew several internal US flights with my family May 2014.

I trusted he would and ran to our next flight dragging my two screaming kids with me. We barely made it before it took off. When we landed in DFW I again waited at the gate for my stroller.

We had a package of frozen fish we did not care to lose. We would approach the podiums for standby only to be advised the flight was already overbooked. On top of that many flights did not have a crew on the ground and had to await arrival on yet another messed up flight. I feel for the employees. Some were very nice and helpful but many but totally burned out and fighting with each other.

I will be stranded in Sao Paulo for four extra days! I consistently attain Premier Silver status and always defend United when other customers complain of how bad an airline it is. Since I fly out of Chicago O'Hare I know I have other options in terms of airlines. I do not even know if I will make it out on July 4. The hotel we are at has provided no information to any of the customers in terms of what is the next step.

I have written to them twice now to protest their terrible baggage policies that encourage people to game the system and bring large heavy luggage to the gate so that they can get it on for free rather than paying for checking. This means long delays and dangerous conditions on board as people try to lift bags that are too heavy for them over the heads of other passengers putting them in danger. Indeed this last flight I took a direct hit on my head from a passenger\\'s backpack that was too heavy for her. No attendant came to see if I was safe and uninjured.

About 30 minutes later we had to deplane for our safety. When we got off the plane we discovered numerous flights had been canceled due to weather. About 15 minutes later they got us back on the plane and told us we just had to fuel up and that they were going to get us to Portland that night. So then we waited out the weather for 6 hours and finally it was clear enough to take off at midnight. However one of the flight attendants timed out right when we were about to push back from the gate at midnight so they canceled it and told us to go wait in the customer service line to rebook. The line stretched over 10 gates and wasn't really helping any customers. Called customer service instead and was told there were no flights from Chicago to Portland until 3 days later and the best they could do for us was fly us to Hartford Connecticut - a 4 hour drive from Portland. Told our luggage would be sent to our destination Portland and would be waiting for us once we drove there.

At the gate they informed us that United overbooked First Class-still plenty of seats on plane-just overbooked First Class-not sure how you do that-since the odds of \"no shows\" happening with FC seats has to be rare. I understand overbooking the plane but not a section. We were told since we did not purchase the tickets with money we were the lucky losers. Someone gave up their seat which put my wife in first class and me in the back. Five years of loyalty resulted in a final reward of getting split up to start our vacation.

Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay.

Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day. The fares are a poor bait and switch tactic and I would be surprised if the FAA does not step in soon.\", \"united airlines In the last month I and my family have flown United four times.

We got off a cancelled flight in Chicago ay 12.30 am and were greeted with nothing more than a toll free number to call for help.

I have to say though that elements of the experience have improved over the last few years. A cloth hot towel has been re-introduced and even though they ran our of food items in the first class cabin the breakfast selection was good. Besides a scrambled eggs option they had a healthy oat bran choice as well that I really enjoyed. Moreover they also came by during the flight with a fruit basket.

The plane was clean the in-flight entertainment had a great selection of movies and TV shows and the crew were very friendly and helpful. The only problem I have with United's international flights is the lack of free beer and wine in Economy Class. Flight 597 to MSP boarded on time but then we sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes before we were given clearance to leave. Once we did finally take off the rest of the flight was fine.

They sent us three rail stops away to the Lufthansa Business Lounge so we could shower after the 10 hour+ flight from Vienna. The Gate Area was a mess with over 300 people crammed into a small area lining up like cattle in divided rows for 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 lanes - worse then Southwest. The plane came in late.

Despite only 8 seats in Global First they don't get to board first. You must wait in Lane 1. Seems like an odd policy. The seats and cabin are very nice no complaints. The video/audio choices extensive except the screen is a little small compared to other carriers. For a transcon the drink/meal service stunk. The flight attendants were pleasant but UA offers no menus no champagne a tiny nut dish of peanuts and almonds limited food choices (chicken or pasta) all served at once on a plastic tray.

In summary I don\\'t understand UA\\'s play. They act like a lowâ€™ cost airline. I say \\'low low\\' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don\\'t understand this. They can\\'t beat Southwest so you\\'d think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since. Your people are your business.', \"united airlines We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.\", \"united airlines We flew LGA-DEN-LAX in United First. Were able to use the United Clubs in both La Guardia and Denver as we were continuing on an international flight from LAX on a Star Alliance Carrier. Pleasant check-in agent checked our bags direct through to Brisbane which saved us having to collect luggage in Los Angeles. First leg on A319 with only 8 in the first cabin was fantastic. One of the best FAs we have ever encountered. Food was very good and drinks flowed freely. Only gripe on this sector was lack of in flight entertainment. The aircraft was equipped with Wi-Fi but you had to pay to use it even in the first class cabin. Not much positive to write about the second leg on B737-900. One food option offered. If you didn't want it too bad. Not even offered a snack from the buy on board menu. Once service was over the FAs sat in the galley and proceeded to talk extremely loudly for the rest of the flight. You could hear them even with headphones on. This aircraft had free TV options. Overall score is largely based on first leg of this trip.\", \"united airlines 20 June 2014.

Overall the product is decent for domestic first class. Crew on all 6 legs were generally very friendly and chatty with the passengers (all were DEN or SFO based). They worked the whole 4 hour flight and were constantly refilling glasses. Food was a little bland but was served well along with fresh baked cookies. Problem is inconsistency in on-board products with old CO aircraft having in seat TV and UA aircraft with old overhead monitors. Some aircraft's with WI-Fi and some without which makes it difficult to work. Of the 6 flights 3 were right on time with early arrivals and 3 were delayed 45 minutes mainly because of ATC issues in NYC area.\", \"united airlines In a recent long-haul flight (UA871) SFO-TPE business class again ran out of the Asian meal option.

With a destination that is Taipei it's astounding that United didn't bother to prepare more Asian food options. It seems to never happen when I fly Asiana Cathay Singapore or Lufthansa. It happens only on United. Is United hedging on meals to save money? And what is this 2-4-2 business class configuration?

Of course because we are having poor weather they can blame it on the weather which means as a customer we cannot recoup anything from them and we have to then wait until a pm flight when we are scheduled on the first flight out of OMA.

I was scheduled to depart at 6pm from NY change planes in Chicago with an hour layover time and land in Minneapolis by 9.30pm. Departing flight was listed \"on time\". 5.45 boarding still had not begun - asked the gate attendant when we would be boarding since I had a connector. He informed me that they were about to delay the flight indefinitely. After advice from customer service that my original flight is unlikely to take off in time for me to make any connection in Chicago I am rebooked on a flight scheduled to depart an hour later - 7pm. However this means I will miss my O\\'Hare connection so that is also rebooked to a 10pm CDT flight. 7pm flight boards on time. Around the time of boarding the originally-scheduled 6pm flight also starts the boarding process. Chaos at the 7pm flight\\'s gate as multiple irate businessmen who had changed out of their 6pm first- class seats for a time-saving economy seat on the 7pm scramble to articulate their outrage and get rebooked on the now-departing earlier flight. At 7.10pm the 7pm flight is finally loaded - and completely full. It\\'s sweltering hot and ripe with body odor and very very dimly lit. 7.20pm: still hot still smelly still dark. Flight attendants are trying their best to be accommodating. The plane finally acquires a couple of pilots 45 minutes after scheduled departure. At this point I am getting nervous that I may miss my re-booked connector as well in which case I will either have to overnight in Chicago or drive the 6.5 hours to St. Paul. The plane touches down in Chicago only a little bit late despite the delay in take-off. Stopped on the runway in the middle of taxi - stops for at least 20 minutes. Flight attendant makes an attempt to ask passengers to remain seated so those with tight connectors can deplane first. His plea is denied immediately by the scores of tired and angry people who flood the corridor before the plane has even reached the gate. Fighting through 35 rows of people I manage to deplane with 10 minutes to spare before boarding call for the connection. Arrive sweaty and out of breath at the gate just as my phone brings up a text from United: flight is delayed until 10.30 because the plane hasn\\'t arrived. The gate attendant changes the sign to read 10.45 instead. Once 1035 hits she updates it once more - to 10.51. In short she assures there is no possible way I will arrive before midnight (CDT). I will never be taking United again.', 'united airlines Flying EWR-NRT with Flight UA 79. Boeing 777. Punishing 14-hr flight in cramped seating condition.

The meals were satisfactory though I am getting a bit bored with the ice cream sundae.

The only thing United\\'s front cabin had going for it was more comfortable seats than in the back of the plane however even that comes with a \"but\". On the 767 the pods next to the window have very limited room for your feet when in the flat position. The aisle seats do seem to have more room. I travel weekly for work so I will continue to fly United but if I were a leisure traveler without frequent flyer status I would choose another airline.

Compare them to All Nippon for example where the attendants are super friendly and bend over backwards for passengers. The return leg was late out of SFO by about 90 minutes. The one saving grace for this United flight was the price which was significantly lower than other TPE-SFO non stops. So I guess you get what you pay for.

After we made it from San Francisco to LA for our re-route the LA flight was delayed an hour due to late aircraft arrival. Once we boarded we waited on the plane for 1 hour after everyone was boarded and settled in. Pilot originally said it was due to weather and admitted it was due to \"paper-work\" before takeoff. Unbelievable. We landed 8 hours after the original time we were told. United uses primarily outdated planes with no on-demand in-flight entertainment. When they do offer their on-demand entertainment like Live DirecTV it costs money. Long flights (7+) could offer good personal TVs but that is rare. Wifi is unheard of my flight months ago was promised wifi but once boarded they claimed the original plane had to be switched so no wifi. Customer service is atrocious also.

Many people complained - the kind cabin steward explained that \"sometimes they just start gate checking toward the end because the bins are usually full at that point\". My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don\\'t work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed \"one carry-on bag and one personal item\" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn\\'t easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead.

Left on time catering was decent (one area the new United hasn't yet cut to the bone) although movie choices were limited to new releases so I read my book and did some work. Immigration at Newark was relatively painless due to the early scheduled arrival time of 1200 beating the afternoon rush. Short visit to the United Club which is comfortable although the snack options are awful. For the second leg to Los Angeles found myself back at the gate I'd arrived at. Some infrequent fliers consider narrowbody hardware unsuitable for long haul as it is â€œcrampedâ€\\x9d or â€œclaustrophic take it from someone who flew on the same 757 all the way from Berlin to LA the size of the seat is the same as the biggest planes (except 10-abreast 777s where it is considerably narrower) and the smaller numbers at boarding baggage claim and immigration mean small is beautiful.

I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night.

Meantime a violent thunderstorm/tornado warning further delayed departure until we were 2.5 hours late leaving. Needless to say our connection to Hilo HI was way gone before we arrived. We were bumped from one customer service desk to another. The line at Gate 71 never moved for an hour. Children were tired and screaming while the customer service reps mumbled useless statements waited for phone returns and after an hour declared we had no hotel or meal compensation because DIA coded the departure as late due to \"weather\". If the plane had been ready at departure time there would have been no delay. The rude and helpless reception at Los Angeles resulted in several of us sleeping in the airport all night missing a full day of reserved vacation time a change in destination from Hilo to Kona a change in car rental arrangements and a long drive around the island instead of 30 miles as originally planned. The scene at the customer service desk was hellish and I was prepared to see any one of the passengers leap across the counter at the inept and uncaring mumbling representatives.

We departed two hours late due to a storm and flight crew distributed water and was generally helpful and good humored. These planes offer standard economy seating not as comfortable as other planes United flies. Bathrooms are extremely tiny and cramped. As opposed to a wide variety of seatback entertainment on UA's 757s from JFK to California this new 737-900 offer no entertainment options at all a major disappointment on such a long flight. These planes may be perfect for a 1-2 hour trip but not for a transcontinental journey.\", \"united airlines London LHR - Newark EWR.

The captain tried his best to kept us updated on the delays. Instruction of allowing passengers to leave the plane during the delay was not clear resulted in passenger wandering around the bridge area. Cabin crew changed after the 2nd delay which turned out to be a plus point to us. Original crew serving the upper deck was grumpy the replacement crew (original crew gone probably due to extended hour) was fantastic provided one of the better quality service to a almost fully filled business class cabin. The plane was old and there was sign of dirt especially around the edges of the window frame. Seat itself was comfortable. It is weird to see UA cramping 2-4-2 seat in business class. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment was average. For the price paid UA has exceeded our expectation.', 'united airlines Six hour delay from San Antonio to Houston. I could have driven there and back. The flight crew and gate staff were so rude! No recompense whatsoever. Not even an apology to the over two hundred passengers.

Indifferent contract staff were clueless regarding arrival facilities at EWR. Ditto for gate agents. Flight attendant told me to check with transfer desk at EWR after clearing customs. Transfer agent told me that there were no arrival facilities unless continuing on with UA. Huh at a UA hub for 1st class? I noticed that meal served in 1st was the same as in Biz albeit with better china. Altogether a thoroughly mediocre experience for a huge premium price. There are many better ways to cross the pond - especially those of us needing to freshen up for post arrival meetings.', \"united airlines May 17th from Toronto to Cancun with a connection in Houston. The plane had a mechanical problem half way to Houston and had to land in Memphis. More than 100 people were asked to stay at Memphis airport and wait for another plane to come. We waited for 7 hours from 1.30 to 8.30. The airport staff first said that the plane would come at 7.30 and later announced that it would be one hour late. All stores in Memphis airport closed around 6.30 and we were all starving. United did at least bring some food for us in this situation. We missed our connecting flight and had to call our hotel and pick-up shuttle to explain the situation. We eventually arrived at Houston around 11pm. There were only 2 people at Houston to help the customers arrange hotels and airport shuttles and they worked extremely inefficiently since they didn't seem to know what to do. In the end it took them 3 hours to get everyone arranged. Up to this point I am totally disappointed with United Airline. I'd rather pay a little more to get a better service. This is my first time flying with United and shall be the last.\", 'united airlines ORD-AMS on a clapped out Boeing 767 which showed its age. The worst experience on this flight were the cabin crew. The most unfriendly lazy rude and uninterested crew I have ever flown with. Shouting at passengers to close the overhead lockers refusing to close these themselves. This is one of their safety duties! The service was slow no peanuts/snacks with the drinks. Dinner was awful cold by the time I was served and totally inadequate for a 7 hr flight. Beer/wine are for sale only and when I asked for a soft drink they offered water only! A second request for a soft drink was rudely refused. Inflight entertainment was terrible small screens and all channels started without any announcement so by the time you wanted to watch anything films were already running for 30 mins.

I could have leave with that but I could not believe that my return flight was cancelled and this time without a notice. I only found out because I couldn't print my boarding pass. I was rescheduled on a flight to LaGuardia and because the agent did not completed the booking I missed the flight and had to be put on another flight 3 hours later.

Snack boxes for purchase but I did not try any. All the staff were friendly except for a grumpy check-in clerk at Louisville. My check-in bag was 54.5 lbs so was asked to remove an item. I pulled out one slipper and that dropped the weight down to 54 lbs and that was acceptable according to the clerk. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. So I put one slipper in my carry on and went on my way. Flew on an EMB175 from Louisville to Houston which was way to small of a plane for that distance but I pretty much slept the whole flight. Then was on a 787 Dreamliner from Houston to Denver. Thought that was kind of a big plane for that flight but what a brilliant aircraft. New quiet and very comfortable. The plane was heading to Tokyo from Denver hence the need for the large craft. Then an A320 on to Reno. Everything went like clockwork so no complaints and my luggage arrived safely minus the slipper I had to take out in Louisville.', 'united airlines Long story short they kept finding reasons to delay and cancel my flights and those of the people around me. It was chaos and passengers all around were complaining of their own horror stories with United. I spent the night in a Chicago airport (admittedly a large part of my nightmare was O\\'Hare airport) and no one who worked there for United seemed to care that I needed a flight out because they were so overwhelmed with the number of flights that were canceled and people that needed to be rebooked. They didn\\'t give me a hotel room because the problem was due to \"weather\" but that was simply not true. They told us on the plane that we boarded that we needed to go back to the airport because the crew had overworked their permitted number of hours and they had no other crew to replace them with. I told them I would literally take any flight that would get me out of that city and the flight I did get was canceled within a few hours of booking it. I went back to customer service and I felt like I was a bother to them for simply needing a way out of there to avoid sleeping on their floors again. It was like it was normal for them to have upset customers and the people like me who didn\\'t give them a hard time were more likely to messed about.', \"united airlines BOS-IAH. I was traveling with my family for holiday from BOS-LAX via IAH. My son is severely allergic to nuts and we always carry Epipen with us. We informed United customer service agent in advance about the allergy they made a note in system and advised us to inform the crew on board. When we informed about the allergy to crew on board flight 488 they told us they can't make announcement about nut allergy due to change in policy and could not able to help us. Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement. After take off they did announce in so low volume that no one really could hear anything. More than 3 million people in the United States report being allergic to peanuts tree nuts or both. I would like to warn those people in advance about the United Nut Policy.\", \"united airlines EWR-PVG on a 777-200. Economy Plus exit window seat. Was able to get this seat without paying for it due to a bug in the online seat map (otherwise it would be an extra $192). Overall it was a satisfying flight given I only paid a little above 600 dollars for this non-stop flight which would usually be over 900. The food was standard but not very adequate. There were friendly flight attendants but some were very rude and indifferent. Entertainment was ok but the system was sluggish. The headset did not work but I was able to use my own earphones. Lavatories were not very well maintained and I didn't see any flight attendant clean it during the entire flight. However all these negative aspects were overpowered by the price and the free exit window seat. Would definitely fly them again.\", \"united airlines All week long flying with our three year old we have preboarded the planes. Well upon boarding a flight that need I say arrived two hours late with United we were told to get in the back of the line with her as they have voided the children board first policy as of this weekend. He was rude about telling us and made it embarrassing as if we were doing something so wrong we were doing what we are used to doing not to mention we didn't just try to be the very first we actually got in line up 2 just because we weren't in any hurry to board. After all we all leave at the same time right? After waiting almost 4 hours at the airport with a toddler because of a delayed flight that's not how to really brighten someone's day and treat them.

The seats in economy are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The United staff - who were long time Continental employees - were very embarrassed and said it should never have happened. And of course it should not have. A deal should be a deal or the airline should warn people in advance that their accumulated miles which they tout as being very valuable are really not so valuable and can become worthless if the airline chooses.

The departure staff were some of the rudest uncooperative staff we have had to deal with. Having stood in \"row 5\" to board and submitting our boarding passes we were told our hand luggage had to be put in the hold as the overhead lockers were full. This was very unsatisfactory as we were ticketed through to Perth. There was no checking of legal size of cabin bags. We saw many oversize bags go aboard including a musical instrument case at least 4 foot long. People putting their second piece in overheads instead of at their feet. If this was policed there would have been room for all legal sized bags. As we are aged 75 and 77 we had medicine required to be taken on the 27 hour journey. After removing medicine we allowed bags to be placed in hold. As the plane was about to leave gate we realized our passports were in our hand luggage. On approaching the head stewardess and the captain and explaining we would be unable to leave USA until passports were returned. Only through the captains orders our hand luggage was unloaded and brought up to the cabin. Full marks to the captain he placed one bag in the cockpit and the head stewardess rearranged some other bags for the second one. This delayed departure by 15 minutes due to the incompetent staff at boarding gate not listening to where we were going.

United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It\\'s very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6\\'1\" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the \"storage\" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music. An hour before landing we were offered a snack consisting of a chicken empanda fruit salad cucumber salad and chocolate. We landed 1/2 hour early and were the first off the plane. All in all a great flight.', 'united airlines Flew a 747-400 from Chicago to Hong Kong. The economy seats were horrible. They were extremely small.

It is a daily flight so they should know when customs opens? Transfer from DEN-EUG had no gate until 2 hours prior which changed 2 times missed the flight because the last change was 20 minutes prior. Next flight out was 10 hours later.

A child around 9 yrs of age was beside himself but still no one came to check on us. We got down safely the second time after being told they were moving to another runway. But even after the plane got down safely not one of the crew came to see if anyone needed any help. The passengers are supposed to come first but in this instance none of us were.

No other mode of transportation was offered neither was a compensation for food or hotel if we had chose to stay and wait the 14 hours. This apparently happens very often. No excuse but they don't have a problem stealing your money and not giving anything in return. This company should not be allowed to run their business this way.

All beverages were free including spirits. This was in economy! Arrived on time in Louisville more than happy with my day flying across country on three different flights. Plus my luggage made it. Maybe I am just lucky but United always seems to work out great for me.

None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question.

United's ground service at EWR was a catastrophe.

The flight out of Houston was delayed about 90 minutes but wasn't United's fault. There were many storms in Texas that night especially in Austin where our plane was coming from. So again the delay was not the fault of United. When we finally did leave we hit a lot of turbulence but that was expected due to the weather. All in all United did OK. Other then a few of their complimentary drinks that's all we had on the plane. We refuse to pay for airline food. Not once on any flight did either my wife or myself use the bathroom.

The biggest mishap was that when we arrived in Los Angeles from Las Vegas we were told there was no room for our carry on luggage so it was checked. My husband's bag went to Hawaii. After many days of talking to people on the phone who obviously have a problem understanding English we finally got his bag delivered.

Request to adjust seat told the plane is 100% full. Okay so I request to adjust seat in advance for my return flight now this is where it gets interesting: I was told by the desk representative that their \"system\" will not let her do so and was advised to use United Airline website to adjust seat myself the only problem is their website does not have the seat change option either.

There were no more flights going out that night and the next day's flights to our destination were completely booked. We were given vouchers for a hotel which we got to at 2.30am and vouchers for food for the next day at the airport.

I will pay extra costs for a flight rather than fly United.', \"united airlines As a seasoned traveler I am constantly reminded what a disgrace United Airlines is to the Star Alliance. I've just completed a Star Alliance Round The World Business First trip on Thai Lufthansa Air Canada Air New Zealand and unfortunately one sector on United. Despite being Gold Elite status and paying $US15000 each for the fare United refused me entry to their lounge in MCO at 0615h - when it was almost totally empty. They seated my wife and I in 3B and 5F for the six hour flight to SFO despite being booked on the one ticket and pre- allocated 1A and 1B four months earlier!

I missed my connecting flight and what a surprise it was my fault and I had to pay for the hotel transport food etc.', \"united airlines Nothing but delays right from the start. We flew Vancouver to Chicago then to Ireland. Everyone had to check in themselves and weren't given seat numbers until boarding so no sitting next to your family. Staff weren't friendly.

We had a connecting flight in Denver. Our flight leaving Boston was delayed 50 minutes our flight arrived in Denver at the exact time our connecting flight from Denver was leaving. United Airlines didn't hold the next plane just a few minutes and so 13 people on our plane missed the connecting flight. The next flight for Sacramento left the next morning so we went to customer service to have them reserve a hotel for us but they claimed that the error was not made by their airline and wouldn't pay for our hotel. Now we have to sit in an airport terminal all night. United Airlines is not a good airline and I won't be flying with them anymore.\", 'united airlines Nightmare with United last week. I had a 1st class ticket Miami-Chicago on UA and Chicago-Zurich-Brussels on Swiss 3 flights on one ticket. Connecting time in Chicago 3 hours and 25 minutes. Checked-in in Miami for my UA flight and Y flight was delayed several times. Finally the plane landed. Ready for boarding and then technical failure was announced. Staff did not know if and when the plane would leave. I explained my situation and asked to be rebooked on another airline any airline in order to leave Miami since I was supposed to have a knee surgery upon my return in Brussels. UA staff refused and were not polite at all. Finally at 8pm announcement that our flight was cancelled. I had spent nearly 7 hours at that airport. I was granted a room at the Holiday Inn airport which was fine and then food vouchers at the same hotel. In total 21 USD for lunch/dinner/breakfast. One thing is for sure never again United. I was rebooked on the day after Miami/Newark/Brussels on the day after first class domestic business class long-haul.

Luckily they gave us hotel accommodation and taxi fares along with also breakfast and dinner vouchers. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. It caused lots of stress.', 'united airlines FRA-SFO on 747-400 this might have been a 9 or 10 star review except for the very late (over 30 minutes) delivery of bags at SFO with priority bags not apparently given any priority - service onboard was impeccable - staff were attentive and professional and did everything they could to make the long flight as comfortable as possible - UA really does need to start handing out pyjamas in F and could also make the bed softer as well as making the blankets thicker and wider if they really want passengers to get some good sleep. Food was OK nothing special - the mushroom soup in a very small cup was the best course while the beef was tough.', \"united airlines I really don't know how to express my dissatisfaction with United. I buy business class and get dumped into economy. No explanation nothing. Trite meaningless apologies are given. That's it. On my return trip the flight attendants were not very attentive in business. Once beverages were served at the beginning of the flight they disappear for the rest of the flight. The dinner meal for a 5.5 hour flight in business is a joke. A small plate of antipasto? That's an appetizer. The customer care program definitely needs improvement. Non responsive and when they do respond they ignore my complaint but do dwell on how great United is and they sincerely hope my next flight will be a good experience. United advertising is good unfortunately they only talk the talk. United has yet to learn how to walk the talk. United just frustrates me to no end.\", 'united airlines Horrible service rude flight attendants check in process rude. The woman told us it was not her job to do the check-in for us when we had questions and the machine would not print or accept my credit card. We were left to our own devices and were just rudely told to hurry up as we were not the only customers there. Since we booked with Lufthansa and paid regular prices and not with a cheap aircraft carrier this behaviour was outrageous! After we finally got our prints (just flight confirmations not boarding cards) we were told we would get the boarding passes at the gate. After asking a couple of times we got our boarding passes just to be told during boarding our daughter could not be seated with us because we were sitting in an emergency exit and she had to sit 7 rows behind us. The cabin attendants were not very helpful and finally we got a nice couple to swap places with us.', 'united airlines April 27 2014 OKC to YYZ my connecting flight was in EWR. When I arrived at Newark I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. The reason for cancellation - bad weather in Toronto. I asked the staff member to find me a different flight the best he could come up with was a flight for the next day! I explained that this was unacceptable. I then asked if I did accept the flight for the next day would I be given a hotel room for the night his response was no because if the flight is cancelled due to weather then the airline is not at fault and does not have to provide a room. To put the cherry on top he would not look for other flights except for the one for the next day. His suggestion was that I researched possible routes home and come speak to him later when I found another flight that was more acceptable to me. I was at a loss. I managed to acquire a flight home that same afternoon to Toronto on Air Canada. What I want to know is how is the weather in Toronto can be a problem for United airlines but not a problem for every other airline in North America. I fly several times a year I will never fly with United Airlines again.', 'united airlines I flew from BTV-EWR-DFW a few months ago and it was by far the worst experience. Outbound flight to EWR was delayed 1 hour 15 minutes. The connection in EWR was missed by about 3 minutes. The customer service agent was useless and also put the blame on myself for missing the connection. I waited about 5.5 hours in what has to have been the dingiest terminal in the US (Newark\\'s C2 concourse) for the next flight to DFW which of course was delayed. Once boarded we sat at the gate for an additional 40 minutes without any communication from the crew. The pilot then informed us that \"it appears the people refuelling this thing put more in the right wing than they did in the left\". We waited yet another 20 minutes for him to come back and say \"to add insult to injury it appears that the APU is broken and it wouldn\\'t be a good idea to fly without it.\" An hour has passed since we boarded and we finally pushed back. The inflight service was sub-par and only one beverage service was offered during the 3.5 hour flight. Overall an appalling experience on an airline that used to be enjoyable. Also if you\\'re not flying international or a hub to hub expect a regional jet or prop plane.', 'united airlines We flew out to San Francisco on Delta on April 27 2014 - a great flight even though we had a longer trip because of storms. The flight waited on us constantly during the long flight. On May 1 2014 we flew home on United 1278. The two stewards and one stewardess were terrible! Went up and down twice during our flight back to Atlanta. I was in a window seat and hey never spoke to me! The pilot did a good job - but did not speak loud enough.', \"united airlines MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it. In one generation United has gone from industry standard to mediocre to absolute lowest common denominator.\", 'united airlines Do not take United flight from Honolulu to Guam. The plane and configuration used is for domestic flights plus there is no inflight entertainment. I fly business first all the time with United.

An unbelievable experience for an airline that generally does very well.', 'united airlines Business class AMS-ORD-YVR. Check in went very smooth departure with 15 minutes delay due to air traffic control. I was seated in a window seat which was ok but if you want to get out of it you have to bother your neighbor.

Terrible service and flights with no entertainment or compensation.', \"united airlines My wife our 10 month old and myself flew from Columbus Ohio to Richmond VA with a stop in Cleveland. Our plane was late getting into Columbus which made us late for our connection in Cleveland. The next available flight wasn't until 8pm that evening giving us a 9 hour layover in Cleveland and causing us to miss the wedding rehearsal dinner we had planned on attending that evening. However when we reached our destination nearly 10hrs from our original arrival time we found that our luggage was lost. We received the same explanation from customer service while our bags flew from Cleveland to Charlotte to who knows where. On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.\", 'united airlines LHR-EWR: sat on tarmac at LHR for 3 hours before being informed the flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue. United tried to re-book us on a flight 24 hours later and only after considerable effort did they find us seats on a (half empty) BA departure. EWR-HR: Flight was overbooked so without asking us we were \"upgraded\" to Ec. Plus. The net result of which was I lost my aisle seat for a middle. I would have preferred to stay in Ec but was not consulted before being moved. The check-in staff at both LHR and EWR are easily the rudest I have ever come across. Also United don\\'t have on-demand entertainment (someone please tell them its 2014 not 2004) and the seats are uncomfortable and narrow. Unless there is a massive price premium please take my advice and fly with a different airline.', \"united airlines I recently booked a flight to Denver from Kansas City trip cost was $376 avoiding other airports I wanted a one way flight to and fro.

We flew from Toronto connecting in Chicago and ending up in New Orleans. First they were an hour late taking off. The pilot said they were contracting out the baggage handling so they were slowly putting one bag at a time on the conveyor. As a result we missed the connection in Chicago. Then 3 (or 4 - I lost count) gate changes and delays. The we boarded then de-boarded. They didn't want to assign seats for 3 of our party even though I had bought and paid for the flights 11 months before they over-book and weren't sure 3 of us would make the flight.

They then directed us to go all the way back across the Airport to get lower quality and separate seats on a much later flight. They attempted no form of compensation or even an apology and acted as if it were our fault and that they were doing us a favor by \\'allowing\\' us to get the terrible seats. The worst of it though is their claim to be both Military and Handicap friendly but they fail in both.', \"united airlines Plane looked extremely old and worn. Food was poor even by airline standards. Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down. Probably the least service-centred flight I ever experienced.

Food and drink service was the same (not much) so can't recommend this. No personal entertainment (was all on the big screen). Food was not good and seems to be deteriorating no longer do they give you any fruit or vegetables but just one course meal and that is it. I also noticed they now charge you for a beer or wine I think they just changed this as of January 2014? I paid an embarrassing $6 for a Heineken which I thought used to be included for Economy Plus? Service was just ok and nothing special. I then flew from ORD to IAD and again Economy Plus but waste of money.

We spent a long time sitting in the plane after being boarded with no explanation before we finally took off. They offered compensation to take a later flight but I had already been delayed for 2+ hours! On the more recent flight the flight was overbooked and I was unable to get on. There were no other flights out of YYC to SEA and I ended up having to cancel my trip. They have not been helpful when I tried to contact them.

I pointed out that I was flying global first 3 times and then demanded that we ask the people inside who said I was of course welcome. After heading into the lounge which at EWR is only a United club not first I went to the gate which was chaotic. They called global services group 1 and I came in behind the one GS person in group 1. I was actually pulled out of line and held back because they said only global services. I asked about global first and group 1 which was being called and was promptly told first class is very different from global services.

FA's were excellent but the plane needs to be retired. Overall a good trip and I truly think once United modernizes its fleet it needs to decide if it wants to compete with the foreign carriers.

This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers.

Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge. And served and cleaned up over 100 passengers within the 45 minutes. It takes that long to get one drink sometimes with United.\", \"united airlines Orange County-SFO Round Trip - April 2014. Be aware: paying extra for an Economy Plus gives you the privilege to board last (group 5).

It happened to us on both legs of this trip even though our carry-ons were undersized and we had only one per person other than my wife's purse and my computer shoulder bag. But for our surcharge we had a free half glass of water served by stern attendants. What a bargain! Too bad Virgin America no longer flies out of SNA. I really miss them.

The aisle was so narrow that the crew could not move their carts without repeatedly banging and bumping into passenger seats.

I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having \"System-wide upgrades\" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be \"eligible\" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one.

I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it.

I tried contacting United and got the following response \"The flight attendants are not required to assist with these type of activities it is strictly up to the flight attendants.\" If you offer no assistance for people traveling alone with multiple children perhaps you should make your customers aware of your flight attendants utter uselessness before they board a plane assuming they will be treated as valued customers.', 'united airlines SFO-LAX and LAX-LHR - in the recent past this airline has made my no-fly list for being unreliable to the point of fitting the description of \"not fit for purpose\" so I was reluctant to use them on this routing but had no choice as it was part of a Star Alliance mileage redemption. In fact both flights were easy to check in with no surprises boarded in an orderly way pushed early the crew were friendly the meal on the 777 from LA to London was tasty the entertainment options on the 777 were diverse and well chosen (and no tedious pre-roll ads before the movies) and my bags were on the carousel promptly. Couldn\\'t ask for more so they\\'re off my no-fly list and fingers crossed for a few more flights like this.

On another experience coming back from LAX going back to Sydney the staff at check were the same - all unhelpful. All they did was stand and talk among themselves.', \"united airlines United Airlines was a disaster to travel through and not worth the amount of stress they cause all of their passengers. I was on a 7 hour flight and they had all movies and shows on repeat. The staff were very unhelpful. My flight ended up getting cancelled and I got re-routed to a much longer flight pattern. There were others I could have taken but United were SO unhelpful that I didn't find out until after the flight. The people there have no idea what they're doing. I was a day late for an important meeting. I received nothing in return for the inconvenience.\", 'united airlines We were on the last leg of our trip at Denver Airport when out flight had been delayed 5 times. After the fifth time they changed out gate assignment and again the flight was delayed twice. After waiting until almost all other flights from the airport were gone for the night our flight was canceled. We were sent to customer service where things were even worse. Told we would have to stay in Denver until late the next day or even until 2 days from then. I was able to find flights the next day on many other airlines but they would not allow. We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids. The customer service lady gave us some vouchers for the food stores in the airport but the stores would not accept these vouchers. I will pay great amounts of money and drive hours to other airports to never use this airline again.', 'united airlines United overbooked my flight. They asked me to take a later flight to Hawaii when I refused they changed my flight anyway which gave me a five hour wait at the SF airport. They offered nothing for this inconvenience and acted as if they were doing me a favor. This was my first and last trip on United.', \"united airlines Very disappointed with my experience with United on Feb 2014. Had a first flight that was oversold we couldn't get on the plane. Had to be re-routed and got 3 flights instead of 2 originally scheduled to arrive at 9 pm instead of 4.30 pm to destination. We found out prior to our last flight that we had not been properly booked into the flight had to be changed to another flight again after an hour of waiting at the understaffed customer service desk. At destination now trying to confirm our seats for the return flight. It's been cancelled! We've tried to call customer service after a 20 minutes wait we're told that we need to be transferred to international flight dept. Another 20 minute wait. Another transfer. We ended up waiting 2hours. Very poor service.\", 'united airlines I was a loyal and frequent Continental flyer for a number of years. All airlines have problems and cause the passengers problems. Continental was not an exception. However I was generally pleased with the aircraft (the newest of fleets) and with service. I recall having been delayed at AUS on a trip to LHR via IAH with my wife. We arrived at IAH with only 3 minutes to spare. We were met with a cart and our passports were checked and tickets issued as we sped along. All that ended with the UAL merger. I got caught in FRA with the merger mess on \"the\" day and since then it has been a series of canceled and long delayed flights with missed connections and very old and ragged aircraft. Most recently I tried to fly AUS to LAX on a CRJ in First. The attendant grabbed my suit coat and started stuffing it in an overhead bin. I objected as I was to go straight into a meeting. Seems the closet had been removed for an additional rows of seats. We were delayed for de-icing then for a malfunctioning APU. Finally at the 2+ hour point we returned to the gate and I deplaned making an AA flight in time. I suspect this is my last UAL attempt. Too unreliable.', \"united airlines Second time in 25 days connection return flight layover +3 hours plus delayed takeoff by 3 hours out of O'Hare. This time there wasn't even any weather issues.

I made a reservation that was non-stop both to Florida and returning home. I'm handicapped and was traveling with my 7 yr. old grandson. The flight to Florida was fine leaving and arriving on time. The flight home was a different story my flight home was cancelled during the night and I was booked on a flight that left 40 min. earlier with a layover in NJ. for 2 hr. then another plane which we had to sit on for 30 min and leaving late. I called and explained why I needed a non stop flight I was told the only non stop plane wasn't leaving until 3 days later. This meant instead of a less the 3 hr flight it was a 7.5 hrs. I was unable to get any help from management customer service.\", 'united airlines London Heathrow to Newark to connect to Fort Lauderdale Florida. My trip to Newark was uneventful. It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it. Needless to say that when I go to Fort Lauderdale my checked baggage was not there and was told it had been left in Newark and would be arriving on the 11pm flight. As I am writing this my baggage has still not been delivered.', \"united airlines Narita Tokyo to Singapore Changi on March 28th. IFE did not work (and even if it did I would be stuck with according to what was in in-flight mag an old and poor quality selection) food awful and had to pay for wine on a transcontinental flight (a first for me). Whole flight experience a bit of a revelation for me as I am used to flying Asian and European carriers. It was a bit like flying a short-hop domestic flight in UK - nothing much really to keep you happy while you are stuck in your seat. Maybe UA treat international flights like their domestic US ones. Even the announcements were the worst I have come across. Purser who did not seem to be able to speak English and a captain who had obviously not been sent on any course about speaking to the public (lacklustre disjointed and very rare). Won't be booking anything with UA again.\", \"united airlines Feb 2 from Newark to Punta Cana flight UA 1520 returned Feb 9 flight UA 1518. Traveled from Newark on March 21 flight UA 423 to Fort Myers. Returned on March 24 flight 1587. What a disappointment! It started at check-in at Newark airport they expect you to do everything and if you ask for help they make it seem they are doing you a huge favor. The seats are super tight have to pay for luggage food TV I'm surprised they don't charge to let you use the bathrooms! They make you feel like you are getting on a bus.\", \"united airlines LAX-SFO-SEA-LAX in United First. Outbound legs to Seattle were great. Service was warm and personalized even if only snack basket and drinks were offered on these short runs. Where United really shined was on the return flight. Original SEA-LAX flight was canceled due to mechanical on inbound aircraft. I received a text message with this update and before I could even get to the agent UA had me rebooked on another carrier getting in just 30 minutes after my original UA routing. When I got up to the agent she had my ticket ready and waiting for me. I fly United almost every week and seldom have cancellations or major delays. Regardless the way they handled this one was flawless and I couldn't have asked for better service all-around.\", 'united airlines 4 Sectors with United YVR-ORD ORD-BOS BOS IAH IAH-YVR. Very poor customer service on the ground and in the air. Greeted at the aircraft door by the usual icy scowl. A \"good morning\" from me totally ignored on all sectors. Officious cabin crew. A request for two drinks met by a terse response of \"We do more than one drink service this is United!\" Hugely oversized carry on bags allowed in the cabin. As a result the last few passengers to board are separated from their carry-ons and ordered to relinquish them even if they are of legal size. Purchased a roast beef sandwich on the 4.5 hour BOS-IAH leg it was tiny soggy and disgusting. On the 5 hour IAH-YVR sector departing at 2100 no hot items for purchase just snack boxes with cheese and crackers. I don\\'t believe that United is any different to any other US airline these days. I can tolerate the ancillary charges the cramped seating the lack of food I understand that\\'s what most of the budget conscience travelers demand these days. But simple manners courtesy and mutual respect cost nothing to provide and sadly they seem to be the most difficult qualities to find in any US airline.', \"united airlines If there is any alternative to flying United take it. The staff do their best but everything about the interface is far from traveler-friendly. First of all the food - and this is in first class - can only be somebody's idea of comedy. Murky chalky flavors and strange un-natural textures characterized every dish I was given. Also on one recent Newark - Los Angeles flight there was were no screens in the plane - no movies no TV. No wireless available and no plugs.\", \"united airlines The worst experience I have encountered when flying. Total disregard to their customers and employees. The poor people at the gate were just beat up to no end and it was not their fault. Flew out of Aspen Colorado which only has 6 gates and 2-3 planes to manage and they could not even accomplish this simple management. United changed my flight without even giving me the courtesy of an e-mail or phone call to check to see if this arrangement was ok. It wasn't even a change in a flight on the same day but they changed the day I was flying out changed from one layover to two layovers changed the total flight time and did not even offer an apology for this inconvenience. In the future the only way I will ever fly United again is if there was no other airline going to this location. A horrible experience.\", \"united airlines I am on a flight to LAX from SFO already delayed by 45 mins waiting for flight crew to arrive.

She eventually got me another cup.\", 'united airlines Denver to Midland scheduled departure time was supposed to be 2.15pm. The flight was delayed 3 times and all while the plane was sitting at the boarding gate. The airline employee spike very broken English. Said that anyone traveling with children needed to be checked due to weight restrictions. She then said that 6 people needed to give up their seats for luggage of other travelers or she would not let the last people that checked in on the flight. No one volunteered so she picked 6 people 2 of which were military personnel. Once on the plane people were told to move seats to even out weight since. We will never fly with this airline again.', \"united airlines First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage. The movie selection available was also decent. Food was okay for the first two meals and the third was disgusting.\", \"united airlines UA 861 from Washington to Rio de Janeiro scheduled to depart at 9.30pm.

The next day I found out that my connection to Sao Paulo to Rio no longer existed so was booked on a later flight with a regional airline. Basically what should've taken me 14 hours took me 48 hours. Furthermore my luggage arrived 2 days afterwards after several phone calls and different answers from United agents. The food served on the plane was inedible. Worst air travel experience. The seat was so crammed for a 9+ hour flight I had to buy premium economy on my way back so that my knees won't hurt.\", \"united airlines Absolutely the worst flight. Both trips were delayed for aircraft mechanical issues. 3 hrs on the way there 4 hrs on the way back. I've never really liked United but we still fly because we were avid Continental flyers for years. I will make it a personal goal to avoid United as an airline for any future flights I have. The price was ridiculous and the service and crew were mediocre at best. I thought United had newer aircraft fleet. Then why are two flights delayed because of mechanical issues?

When I asked the cabin crew if I was obliged to have this person sitting \"on top\" of me she stated he was allowed to put his seat back. As a result I sat for 6 hours approx with no reasonable space in front of me. I got no food as there was no room to let down my food tray.', \"united airlines Both coming from and going to our destination the check in staff were very rude and difficult to work with.

Instead of providing us with a direct flight to Toronto we were put on 2 connecting flights these were delayed repeatedly until they were cancelled. We finally asked after waiting for 2 hours if there were any other flights to get home. We were put on an Air Canada flight to Toronto leaving at 2pm but told to go to terminal D to secure our seats and boarding passes but then were told to go to another Terminal and eventually found out this flight was leaving on March 13th a day later not 2pm on March 12th. Finally we went to counter 1 where a staff member helped fly us back to Toronto. We unfortunately had a 2nd overnight flight and although we left Honolulu on March 11th at 7pm we only landed into Toronto 6.45am Thur March 14th.

Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service.

While my bag was not over the size the agents take joy in making you size it and have the \"got you\" attitude.

The service by both check in staff and onboard staff was perfect a lot of passenger complaints for this airline relate to staff attitudes well the attitude question works both ways some passengers are downright rude to check in and cabin crew. I have one or two gripes about the flights I am amazed at what is allowed on board as hand luggage are these people so important that saving a few minutes by missing baggage reclaim is of paramount importance to them.

After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes.

Luckily our travel agent called American Airlines and got us a flight in one hour.', 'united airlines Flew United SYD-SFO in Economy Plus. Paid $200 for exit row seat so unlimited legroom. Staff business like but not rude. Soft drinks offered soon after takeoff. Dinner was basic but that was actually welcome - steamed chicken 4 slightly shrivelled chips veg tiny Apple pie drinks offered again. Water was offered twice during overnight and a midnight ham roll and Tim Tam for those awake. Breakfast was omelette and barely recognisable sausage. IFE was shared screens but I used iPad. Overall not as unpleasant as I had feared.', 'united airlines Flight from Midland to Salt Lake City was great. Both planes were small but that was fine. The crew were great and the reason I purchased the tickets was because it was the fastest flight. The layover was short and it was easy to find my next gate. We left and arrived on time. On my way back however totally different! I had a 6.20 flight and arrived at the airport at 4.30. The line for United Airlines was so long it extended the length of the terminal and out of the door. I stood in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes! No information given and the line did not move very quickly at all. Finally at 6 am a woman working for United started walking down the line asking if anyone was going on the 6.20 flight to IAH. Over 30 people left the line to stand in yet another line for an additional 10 minutes. No explanation was offered no apologies given. We were rushed through first class passenger line of security and I boarded the plane at 6:15 am. The plane was half full because everyone was still waiting in line. Our flight left at 6.45 because we had to wait on all the other passengers. The pilot did his best to make up time in the air and I made in time to make my connecting flight. I still have no idea what happened in SLC it seemed to me like a lot of laziness and poor customer service.', 'united airlines Flew Dublin - Newark - Washington Dulles on 6th March on a B757 and then a D8. The cross Atlantic flight was fine on time reasonable seat good choice of movies etc. but the food was very poor - potatoes hard as was the bread no choice - it was meat or meat. On the hop from Newark to Dulles I was surprised how noisy it was though I was close to the engines. United seem to call people forward now by group number as printed on there boarding pass as opposed to seat number blocks. Not sure it helps and fail to see the logic of filling from the front back - getting the people at the back in first means less blocked aisles.', \"united airlines It has taken me in excess of an hour to resolve what should be a simple matter on the phone with their customer service flights are always late (which I understand is not always the airline's fault but most of my late flights result from insufficient crew which they can do something about). The coach cabin is a mess and even first class which I usually take is sub par. Last time I flew first class they gave me a hard time when I asked for milk for my toddler children! Not to mention that they ran out of food. I already had low expectations for them but I did not expect to bring my own food to first class. Avoid at all costs.\", 'united airlines NRT-BKK. Uneventful trip on a route about to be abandoned by United. Surprising considering the 747 was packed to the brim. Boarding was chaotic and those of us in business class had no idea where to line up to board. Nice hard product but uninspiring service and meal. Overworked flight attendant working business class in the dome got the job done though. Pilot had Channel 9 (air traffic control) activated which is one of the nice features that only United can claim. The RCC lounge at NRT has much to be desired - hands down had the worst cappuccino in my life there.', 'united airlines Flew from Newark to Denver where United decided without any form of communication to hold 2 of our bags to arrive with the next flight to Denver 3 hours later. After arriving in Denver we waited at the baggage carousel for nearly an hour until we were fully convinced 2 of our bags did not make the flight. Throughout the night we tried calling different customer service numbers of United and could not get a straightforward answer. 20 hours later our bags reached us. On our flight back from Denver to Newark the entire flight was boarded seat belts fastened welcomed by the pilot until another announcement from the pilot came on and I quote \"there is a small problem. Should be a quick fix that will take best case 30 minutes\". 10 minutes later we are told to deboard the plane because this \"quick fix problem\" has caused the plane to be completely out of service. As we all deboard our entire flight is told to go to one customer service desk with 4 representatives. Nearly an hour later we finally get up to the representatives and all I hear is a potential flight to Houston reboard the out-of-commission plane at 3.30 or wait until tomorrow.

Never again!', 'united airlines Flew UAL 218 first class from HNL-ORD then connected to UAL express ORD-YWG. Service better than expected. 777-200 had recliner seats with no flatbeds for an 8 hour flight. No inflight entertainment as WiFI was not working and the old school entertainment system had already been removed. In-Charge offered all passengers compensation through UA Website. Offer on the web site was $125 off the next UA Flight for US residents or 10% off next UA flight to be used within 1 year for international travellers. Dinner and breakfast were served. Quality of both meals were OK and reminded me of Y class meals from days gone by. Ice cream sundae cart made the rounds after dinner. First Class Attendants ensured beverages were topped up and one FA even made sure water glasses were topped up while passengers slept. Difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in recliner chairs. However the ticket price was reasonable for the passenger space offered on the aircraft. For an 8 hour overnight flight First class should offer flatbeds IMHO. UAL Express connector flight ORD-YWG ran 1 hour late due to off loading of baggage when connecting passengers failed to show. Almost an expected delay on any airline these days.', \"united airlines LAX-JFK and return. Never flew United previously so after reading many reviews had lowered my expectations. I thought it was pretty good. I paid extra for more legroom which was well worth the money. Cabin crew came through the cabin regularly offering water or juice on the JFK-LAX leg in particular. The seats are more comfortable than Qantas economy and likewise the entertainment was a bit better also. My biggest complaint is the amount of luggage/baggage United allow passengers to drag onto the plane. If you are Group 5 (aisle seats) and the last to board all the bins are full of people's stuff from seats away! Even a pre-boarding offer to check wheelie bags for free due to a full flight was met with disinterest. It really is one area needing tightening up.\", 'united airlines I used to like flying United but the last couple of trips have really make me think about other airlines. I had to fly to Honolulu in January to take care of my mom for 2 weeks. They canceled my departing flight. My flight from Houston was delayed 2 hours and there was no personal TV on the flight. Flying home it was the same. I had to return to Honolulu in Feb. The flight to and from had no personal TV. I am not a savy personal and do not have I- pads or any personal electronics (and there were many other people like me on the plane) so using Wi-Fi did us no good.

The customer service for this airline really needs to be greatly improved. I book my flights in advance so I can have what I want and schedule what I am doing when I get there. So to have my flights canceled and rebooked for a flight that doesn't even come close to when my connecting flight leaves the airport is a bit stupid. Now I have to have a longer flight just to get where I want to go by flying in the opposite direction of where I want to go. To top it all off I wasn't even notified of the change. Now I have to change my plans so I can accommodate the airlines wishes. Next time I think I will book with another company that I have had no problems with.\", \"united airlines LAS-LAX-RNO. One way trip at the last moment due to family matters. Had enough miles in the bank to make this work. The schedule was perfect albeit a change of planes in LAX but only a short layover. Took off from Vegas a few minutes late. A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means.

Loyalty means nothing customer service is non-existent and upgrades uncommon.

Been flying a different airline starting this year since they offered elite status for flying a few thousand miles during a certain timeline so far so good!\", 'united airlines Hong Kong to Newark on March 1. Flight crew was tired and cranky with bad attitudes across the board. One in- flight announcement was literally a snide \"buckle your seat belt it\\'s bumpy\". Where other airlines turn a galley into a quasi-lounge area during such a long flight (15 hours) we were told there was to be no loitering around the galley or toilet areas.

Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane. Now I have to contact Customer Service as no one in the Service Center in the Denver Airport is authorized to do so. I am dreading the return flight home. I will be flying on other carriers from now on.', 'united airlines Just arrived at my hotel after a horrendous 24-hour trip from Montreal to Honolulu. The missed connection and re- routing through LAX was bad enough but I guess winter weather is a reality. What is not acceptable is this new DirecTV-United deal for in-flight \"entertainment\". Now in addition to having to pay extra for a poor sandwich wrap they\\'ve got the gall to make you cough up extra to watch a movie. I object to paying for what is standard on other airlines. They take your money $1000-2000 and then expect you to pay for a movie - or even a flight map.

I also bought the Premier Accelerator and Reward Accelerator erroneously thinking that I would maintain my Status Match level with this flight. The \"fine print\" here is that the Accelerator is not permitted in achieving status if you\\'re doing a Match but their web site will continually advertise it to you like it is.

Staff in the business class lounge were unhelpful badly informed and unfriendly. Flight was delayed and we were initially held sitting on board for several hours. Then had to de-board and a few hours later the flight was cancelled. We had to exit through the baggage hall. Despite having a lot of baggage and having already been assured we could leave our checked baggage with United staff one member of staff told us \"we won\\'t look after this anybody can take it and it\\'s not our responsibility and then decided to insist we take our bags out immediately. The hotel United put us in was dreadful. Put on a fight the following day. We used air miles to upgrade to business class: United\\'s configuration of the new extra-slim business class seats is awful. 2x4x2. Paying business class and being stuck in the middle with no dividers between two people you don\\'t know? Hardly classy treatment! Seats are so thin that anyone with broad shoulders will be very uncomfortable. One of the internal flights in the USA was so cold that everyone sat shivering in their overcoats. At every airport in the USA staff were at best ungracious and unfriendly. Everything was too much trouble for them. United has also downgraded its Silver status so that now you only get one free bag not two. It is very sad to see the appalling way that United Airlines\\' service has plummeted.', \"united airlines FLL to EWR to SFO.

The gate agent refused to assist me in finding another route home since 2 hours had passed and I was certain I'd missed my connection in SFO. No hotel because they said the delay was due to weather not incompetence. The new customer focus they speak of is a facade. Flight was Feb 21. SFO has comfortable chairs but not to sleep on.\", \"united airlines I'm currently sitting at the gate for my United flight at LAX. A gentleman came out of the gate off of a flight obviously in a hurry and quickly asked where the connecting flight for Newark was.

They closed the doors for the tarmac before all passengers were inside which left them outside knocking on the door. Not one member of the staff let them in so an airline customer opened the door which set off an alarm. Again the staff did nothing and let the alarm go off for minutes.

Storage was a bit tricky and always a pain since all pax are not checking luggage so it gets full leg room is quite cramped even though I'm only 5'8''. Landing was good and was out the airport within 10 minutes. first leg was delayed 1 hour due to late turn around of the plane pilots were very informative throughout.

Total time should have been 6-7 hours. Problems started in Los Angeles when the gate person told us that there was a mechanical problem on the plane. Many people had connecting flights and so a long line formed. One person was at the desk creating new boarding passes. For some reason it took him about 10000 keystrokes to issue each pass. Two hours he issued a total of two boarding passes. The line became exceedingly long and then he called in a manager who whispered in his ear then left.

Got to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare. 4/7 of my group members got seats. Three were put up in a hotel for the afternoon and the closest United could get them to FLL the same day was to fly to MEM. They arrived in MEM only having to drive 13 hours to get to FLL. They were fairly compensated that was the only good part of the outbound trip. On the way back check in was a breeze as it was deserted. Ended up getting to the gate with about 2 hours to spare. Plane was delayed about 25 minutes aggravating but didn't lose any sleep over it. Got into ORD a couple minutes late. My connection to YWG was supposed to be 40 minutes but our plane which was coming in from SAV was 4.5 hours late leaving thus delaying us 4.5 hours. I was insulted as we only received a $7 voucher.

Pros: two helpful ground agents and warm friendly lounge staff at LAX. Decent IFE and comfortable seat for the 5 hour flight. Cons: Too many to mention but mainly staff attitude about everything. Even the simplest task is completed with a sigh and a roll of the eyes. I've never experienced boarding a flight before while the crew talked amongst themselves and literally ignored passengers boarding - not even a request to show boarding passes. I've honestly never been tested with such consistent disdain by employees of a company to which I'm paying a considerable chunk of money. It got to the point where I just smiled to myself with amusement at their unprofessional and frankly useless and unhelpful manner. I only flew UA as a code share with AirNZ but can honestly say I will never ever waste my time or money again.\", 'united airlines This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we \"accepted\" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told \"United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA\\'s promise that we are \"flying the friendly skies\".', 'united airlines My sister wife and I travelled Heathrow to Chicago to Denver and onto Minot ND.

They haven't informed passengers that due to delays their connection flight (on the same flight number as from Portland to Las Vegas through San Francisco) would be missed - they knew that before boarding the first plane. Secondly they ignored passengers who had to sleep at San Francisco airport on the floor having all restaurants and half of restrooms closed. When coming back from US to Poland (3 flights - 17 hours) I couldn't check an additional bag (as I should have Star Alliance Silver status) informing me that these were Lufthansa regulations and they have their own united and they don't care or I will have to pay 200$.

On our arrival we learned that after what was to be a 12-13 hour flight that turned into a twenty something hour flight zig zagging across country. United did not have our luggage and it was sitting in an airport in New Jersey.', 'united airlines Flight from Houston to SLC on 2/1/2014 a family of six including a 6 year old 4 year old and twin 2 year olds. When we checked in at the gate the gentleman at the gate was very short and rude and bluntly stated that we had not reserved our seating online as required when actually we had several months in advance. He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate. I would not recommend United Airlines to any families as none of our flights were accommodating to young families with kids and car seats as most airlines are.', 'united airlines Lost bags delayed flights lack of communication wrong allocation of seats (such as row 50 in an airline that only has 46 rows) and rude staff have made my collective experience with United Airlines a negative one. To give them 1 star for each of these categories is a stretch. I wish I had read the reviews before booking so many flights with them as it seems that the rest of their previous customers are just as satisfied as I. Literally days wasted in airports and kilometres walked trying to get answers from staff who clearly are in the wrong line of work given their communication skills. Never again.', \"united airlines I took United from Paris to Washington DC and then from DC to Richmond VA. The first flight was ok despite no communication or service from the crew. The second flight has one hour delay so far. Not very happy about flying with United. I won't recommend it.\", 'united airlines DEN-LHR on Christmas Eve. No food service for 50% of Economy class cabin as crew claimed that ground staff forgot to load enough food for all passengers in this class due to \"holiday mood\". When complained to crew they said it is unfortunate and can send letter to head office if dis-satisfied with service. Last time to fly with UA.', 'united airlines Newark to Hong Kong in Economy Plus. The flight left early and arrived late which made for a 16.5 hour flight. It was a very smooth flight and the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off 2 hours after take-off. I asked for a glass of red wine and was told that United began charging $7.99 a glass on flights across the Pacific Ocean on Jan 1 2014. No hot towels were provided. The meal came with plastic tableware. The individual in-flight entertainment worked well on the 777-200. 2 hours before landing there were a couple of bumps and the fasten seatbelt sign was on for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. On a 16 hour flight it is nice to use the toilet to freshen up before landing. No toothbrush or socks were provided. I purchased the more expensive W ticket because I had an upgrade but the business/first section was full two weeks before departure.', \"united airlines We flew from Newark to Panama City Panama. Flight arrived 30 mins late at 11pm. The flight was OK except for no entertainment as the paying entertainment was not worth it. No free food even that had to be paid for - we didn't. Pilots were pretty uncommunicative and the cabin crew indifferent. The seats are real torture too narrow hard and poor legroom combine to make 5 hours feel like forever!\", \"united airlines Flew Denver to Tokyo Flight left 2 hrs. late (mech) so we missed our connecting flight arrived 9 hrs late. On the way back they changed our seats at boarding and put us next to the bathroom got to hear the toilet flush and the door slam for 10 hours I'll never fly United again.\", \"united airlines IAD to DEN. Economy class on a 757. On time for departure and arrival quite good service from attendants. Aircraft sported outdated overhead CRT for in flight entertainment and my audio jack didn't work correctly. Also no wifi or power outlets. Seats comfy but a little small. Had to pay 9 dollars for a large snack which is too much frankly. Fine for the low fare I got but not much else.\", \"united airlines We flew to Geneva from ABQ on 1/16 - 1/26. Flight UA5176 UA907 UA975Y UA783Y. To start we had a 5 hr delay and our party of 6 had to be split up and re-routed to reach our overseas destination (this was not due to weather). United offered us a measly 7$ credit that was only usable in one airport for food. It didn't even cover a meal. When we finally were on our way there were further delays (once again not weather) and upon arrival our party was split and we had to pt double to take the shuttle separately to our hotel. Very frustrating trip with United!\", \"united airlines IAH to CVG: Crowded dirty late with poor customer service from distracted personnel. They act like they simply don't care. If you enjoy riding Greyhound Bus Lines and want to have that same experience in the air fly United.\", \"united airlines I purchased first class tickets hoping to make the experience a little better it didn't help. The food on the flight is horrible. You get a snack box which consists of a couple of crackers some cheese spread a fig cookie and some kind of cranberry bar. That is not first class service to me. To make matters worse my bags were lost. It would have taken them two hours to drive it to me instead they had to fly it back then ship it to the correct place. This took about 24 hours when it should have taken 2. To make matters even worse on the flight home my bags didn't make it again. I was told they got put on the later flight. I won't be flying United anymore.\", 'united airlines I personally have had few problems with them over the last several months. Recently did DEN-SFO-HNL and back. All flights on time and with early arrivals DEN-SFO segments with newer aircraft with PTVs. The SFO-HNL segments were on the oldest 777 I have ever seen - no food no entertainment nothing for 5 hours is not really acceptable. Crews smiled on all segments and actually seemed happy to be at work which is a change. Ground staff at SFO were also helpful.', 'united airlines Flew United 261 LAX to Orlando Economy Plus.
